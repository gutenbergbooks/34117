<h3>PROF. WILLIAM WITHERLE LAWRENCE</h3>

  <p><span class="sc">Dear Prof. Lawrence</span>,</p>

  <p>When, more than four years ago, I asked you to allow me to dedicate
  this volume to you, it was as a purely personal token of gratitude for
  the help I had received from what you have printed, and from what you
  have written to me privately.</p>

  <p>Since then much has happened: the debt is greater, and no longer
  purely personal. We in this country can never forget what we owe to your
  people. And the self-denial which led them voluntarily to stint
  themselves of food, that we in Europe might be fed, is one of many things
  about which it is not easy to speak. Our heart must indeed have been
  hardened if we had not considered the miracle of those loaves. But I fear
  that to refer to that great debt in the dedication to this little book
  may draw on me the ridicule incurred by the poor man who dedicated his
  book to the Universe.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, as a fellow of that College which has just received from
  an American donor the greatest benefaction for medical research which has
  ever been made in this country of ours, I may rejoice that the
  co-operation between our nations is being continued in that warfare
  against ignorance and disease which some day will become the only warfare
  waged among men.</p>

<h3>PREFACE</h3>

  <p>I have to thank various colleagues who have read proofs of this book,
  in whole or in part: first and foremost my old teacher, W.&nbsp;P. Ker; also
  Robert Priebsch, J.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;G. Grattan, Ernest Classen and two old students,
  Miss E.&nbsp;V. Hitchcock and Mrs Blackman. I have also to thank Prof. W.&nbsp;W.
  Lawrence of Columbia; and though there are details where we do not agree,
  I think there is no difference upon any important issues. If in these
  details I am in the right, this is largely due to the helpful criticism
  of Prof. Lawrence, which has often led me to reconsider my conclusions,
  and to re-state them more cautiously, and, I hope, more correctly. If, on
  the other hand, I am in the wrong, then it is thanks to Prof. Lawrence
  that I am not still more in the wrong.</p>

  <p>From Axel Olrik, though my debt to him is heavy, I find myself
  differing on several questions. I had hoped that what I had to urge on
  some of these might have convinced him, or, better still, might have
  drawn from him a reply which would have convinced me. But the death of
  that great scholar has put an end to many hopes, and deprived many of us
  of a warm personal friend. It would be impossible to modify now these
  passages expressing dissent, for the early pages of this book were
  printed off some years ago. I can only repeat that it is just because of
  my intense respect for the work of Dr Olrik that, where I cannot agree
  with his conclusions, I feel bound to go into the matter at length. Names
  like those of Olrik, Bradley, Chadwick and Sievers carry rightly such
  authority as to make it the duty of those who differ, if only on minor
  details, to justify that difference if they can.</p>

  <p>From Dr Bradley especially I have had help in discussing various of
  these problems: also from Mr Wharton of the British Museum, Prof. Collin
  of Christiania, Mr Ritchie Girvan of Glasgow, and Mr Teddy. To Prof.
  Brøgger, the Norwegian state-antiquary, I am indebted for permission to
  reproduce photographs of the <!-- Page viii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pageviii"></a>{viii}</span>Viking ships: to Prof. Finnur Jónsson
  for permission to quote from his most useful edition of the <i>Hrólfs
  Saga</i> and the <i>Bjarka Rímur</i>, and, above all, to Mr Sigfús
  Blöndal, of the Royal Library of Copenhagen, for his labour in collating
  with the manuscript the passages quoted from the <i>Grettis Saga</i>.</p>

  <p>Finally, I have to thank the Syndics of the University Press for
  undertaking the publication of the book, and the staff for the efficient
  way in which they have carried out the work, in spite of the long
  interruption caused by the war.</p>

<h2>PART I</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE HISTORICAL ELEMENTS</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section I. The Problem.</span></p>

  <p>The unique <span class="scac">MS</span> of <i>Beowulf</i> may be, and
  if possible should be, seen by the student in the British Museum. It is a
  good specimen of the elegant script of Anglo-Saxon times: "a book got up
  with some care," as if intended for the library of a nobleman or of a
  monastery. Yet this <span class="scac">MS</span> is removed from the date
  when the poem was composed and from the events which it narrates (so far
  as these events are historic at all) by periods of time approximately
  equal to those which separate us from the time when Shakespeare's
  <i>Henry V</i> was written, and when the battle of Agincourt was
  fought.</p>

  <p>To try to penetrate the darkness of the five centuries which lie
  behind the extant <span class="scac">MS</span> by fitting together such
  fragments of illustrative information as can be obtained, and by using
  the imagination to bridge the gaps, has been the business of three
  generations of scholars distributed among the ten nations of Germanic
  speech. A whole library has been written around our poem, and the result
  is that this book cannot be as simple as either writer or reader might
  have wished.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The story which the <span class="scac">MS</span> tells us may be
  summarized thus: Beowulf, a prince of the Geatas, voyages to Heorot, the
  hall of Hrothgar, king of the Danes; there he destroys a monster Grendel,
  who for twelve years has haunted the hall by night and slain all he found
  therein. When Grendel's mother in revenge makes an attack on the hall,
  Beowulf seeks her out and kills her also in her home beneath the waters.
  He then <!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page2"></a>{2}</span>returns to his land with honour and is
  rewarded by his king Hygelac. Ultimately he himself becomes king of the
  Geatas, and fifty years later slays a dragon and is slain by it. The poem
  closes with an account of the funeral rites.</p>

  <p>Fantastic as these stories are, they are depicted against a background
  of what appears to be fact. Incidentally, and in a number of digressions,
  we receive much information about the Geatas, Swedes and Danes: all which
  information has an appearance of historic accuracy, and in some cases can
  be proved, from external evidence, to be historically accurate.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section II. The Geatas&mdash;their Kings and their Wars.</span></p>

  <p>Beowulf's people have been identified with many tribes: but there is
  strong evidence that the Geatas are the Götar (O.N. <i>Gautar</i>), the
  inhabitants of what is now a portion of Southern Sweden, immediately to
  the south of the great lakes Wener and Wetter. The names <i>Geatas</i>
  and <i>Gautar</i> correspond exactly<a name="NtA3"
  href="#Nt3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, according to the rules of O.E. and O.N.
  phonetic development, and all we can ascertain of the Geatas and of the
  Gautar harmonizes well with the identification<a name="NtA4"
  href="#Nt4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>We know of one occasion only when the Geatas came into violent contact
  with the world outside Scandinavia. Putting together the accounts which
  we receive from Gregory of Tours and from two other (anonymous) writers,
  we learn that a piratical raid was made upon the country of the Atuarii
  (the O.E. <i>Hetware</i>) who dwelt between the lower Rhine and what is
  now the Zuyder Zee, by a king whose name is spelt in a variety of ways,
  all of which readily admit of identification with that of the Hygelac of
  our poem<a name="NtA5" href="#Nt5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. From the land of
  the Atuarii this king carried much spoil to his ships; but, remaining on
  shore, he was overwhelmed and slain by the army which the <!-- Page 3
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page3"></a>{3}</span>Frankish king
  Theodoric had sent under his son to the rescue of these outlying
  provinces; the plunderers' fleet was routed and the booty restored to the
  country. The bones of this gigantic king of the "Getae" [presumably =
  Geatas] were long preserved, it was said, on an island near the mouth of
  the Rhine.</p>

  <p>Such is the story of the raid, so far as we can reconstruct it from
  monkish Latin sources. The precise date is not given, but it must have
  been between <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 512 and 520.</p>

  <p>Now this disastrous raid of Hygelac is referred to constantly in
  <i>Beowulf</i>: and the mention there of Hetware, Franks and the
  Merovingian king as the foes confirms an identification which would be
  satisfactory even without these additional data<a name="NtA6"
  href="#Nt6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>(1) Gregory of Tours (d. 594):</p>

  <p><i>His ita gestis, Dani cum rege suo nomine Chlochilaico evectu navale

  Theudorici devastant atque captivant, oneratisque navibus tam de captivis

  secuturus. Quod cum Theudorico nuntiatum fuisset, quod scilicet regio
  ejus fuerit ab extraneis devastata, Theudobertum, filium suum, in illis
  partibus cum valido exercitu et magno armorum apparatu direxit. Qui,
  interfecto rege, hostibus navali proelio superatis opprimit, omnemque
  rapinam terrae restituit.</i></p>

  <p>The name of the vanquished king is spelt in a variety of ways:
  <i>Chlochilaichum</i>, <i>Chrochilaicho</i>, <i>Chlodilaichum</i>,
  <i>Hrodolaicum</i>.</p>

  <p>See <i>Gregorii episcopi Turonensis Historia Francorum</i>, p. 110, in
  <i>Monumenta Germaniae Historica (Scriptores rerum merovingicarum,

  <p>(2) The <i>Liber Historiae Francorum</i> (commonly called the <i>Gesta
  Francorum</i>):</p>

  <p><i>In illo tempore Dani cum rege suo nomine Chochilaico cum navale
  hoste per alto mare Gallias appetent, Theuderico paygo [i.e. pagum]

  <p>The <i>Liber Historiae Francorum</i> was written in 727, but although
  so much later than Gregory, it preserves features which are wanting in
  the earlier historian, such as the mention of the Hetware
  (<i>Attoarii</i>). Note too that the name of the invading king is given
  in a form which <!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page4"></a>{4}</span>approximates more closely to <i>Hygelac</i>
  than that of any of the <span class="scac">MSS</span> of Gregory:
  variants are <i>Chrochilaico</i>, <i>Chohilaico</i>, <i>Chochilago</i>,
  etc.</p>

  <p><i>Et sunt [monstra] mirae magnitudinis: ut rex Huiglaucus qui

  <p>This treatise was first printed (from a <span class="scac">MS</span>
  of the tenth century, in private possession) by J. Berger de Xivrey
  (<i>Traditions tératologiques</i>, Paris, 1836, p. 12). It was again
  published from a second <span class="scac">MS</span> at Wolfenbüttel by
  Haupt (see his <i>Opuscula</i> <span class="scac">II</span>, 223, 1876).
  This <span class="scac">MS</span> is in some respects less accurate,
  reading <i>Huncglacus</i> for <i>Huiglaucus</i>, and <i>gentes</i> for
  <i>Getis</i>. The treatise is assigned by Berger de Xivrey to the sixth
  century, on grounds which are hardly conclusive (p. xxxiv). Haupt would
  date it not later than the eighth century (<span class="scac">II</span>,
  220).</p>

  <p>The importance of this reference lies in its describing Hygelac as
  king of the Getae, and in its fixing the spot where his bones were
  preserved as near the mouth of the Rhine<a name="NtA7"
  href="#Nt7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But if <i>Beowulf</i> is supported in this matter by what is almost
  contemporary evidence (for Gregory of Tours was born only some twenty
  years after the raid he narrates) we shall probably be right in arguing
  that the other stories from the history of the Geatas, their Danish
  friends, and their Swedish foes, told with what seems to be such historic
  sincerity in the different digressions of our poem, are equally based on
  fact. True, we have no evidence outside <i>Beowulf</i> for Hygelac's
  father, king Hrethel, nor for Hygelac's elder brothers, Herebeald and
  Hæthcyn; and very little for Hæthcyn's deadly foe, the Swedish king
  Ongentheow<a name="NtA8" href="#Nt8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>And in the last case, at any rate, such evidence might <!-- Page 5
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"></a>{5}</span>fairly have been
  expected. For there are extant a very early Norse poem, the <i>Ynglinga
  tal</i>, and a much later prose account, the <i>Ynglinga saga</i>,
  enumerating the kings of Sweden. The <i>Ynglinga tal</i> traces back
  these kings of Sweden for some thirty reigns. Therefore, though it was
  not composed till some four centuries after the date to which we must
  assign Ongentheow, it should deal with events even earlier than the reign
  of that king: for, unless the rate of mortality among early Swedish kings
  was abnormally high, thirty reigns should occupy a period of more than
  400 years. Nothing is, however, told us in the <i>Ynglinga tal</i>
  concerning the deeds of any king Angantyr&mdash;which is the name we
  might expect to correspond to Ongentheow<a name="NtA9"
  href="#Nt9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>But on the other hand, the son and grandson of Ongentheow, as recorded
  in <i>Beowulf</i>, <i>do</i> meet us both in the <i>Ynglinga tal</i> and
  in the <i>Ynglinga saga</i>.</p>

  <p>According to <i>Beowulf</i>, Ongentheow had two sons, Onela and
  Ohthere: Onela became king of Sweden and is spoken of in terms of highest
  praise<a name="NtA10" href="#Nt10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>. Yet to judge from
  the account given in <i>Beowulf</i>, the Geatas had little reason to love
  him. He had followed up the defeat of Hygelac by dealing their nation a
  second deadly blow. For Onela's nephews, Eadgils and Eanmund (the sons of
  Ohthere), had rebelled against him, and had taken refuge at the court of
  the Geatas, where Heardred, son of Hygelac, was now reigning, supported
  by Beowulf. Thither Onela pursued them, and slew the young king Heardred.
  Eanmund also was slain<a name="NtA11" href="#Nt11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>,
  then or later, but Eadgils escaped.</p>

  <p>It is not clear from the poem what part Beowulf is supposed to have
  taken in this struggle, or why he failed to ward off disaster from his
  lord and his country. It is not even made clear whether or no he had to
  make formal submission to the hated Swede: but we are told that when
  Onela withdrew he succeeded to the vacant throne. In later days he took
  his revenge upon Onela. "He became a friend to Eadgils in his distress;
  he supported the son of Ohthere across the broad water with men, with
  warriors and arms: he wreaked his <!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page6"></a>{6}</span>vengeance in a chill journey fraught with woe:
  he deprived the king [Onela] of his life."</p>

  <p>This story bears in its general outline every impression of true
  history: the struggle for the throne between the nephew and the uncle,
  the support given to the unsuccessful candidate by a rival state, these
  are events which recur frequently in the wild history of the Germanic
  tribes during the dark ages, following inevitably from the looseness of
  the law of succession to the throne.</p>

  <p>Now the <i>Ynglinga tal</i> contains allusions to these events, and
  the <i>Ynglinga saga</i> a brief account of them, though dim and
  distorted<a name="NtA12" href="#Nt12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>. We are told
  how Athils (=Eadgils) king of Sweden, son of Ottar (=Ohthere), made war
  upon Ali (=Onela). By the time the <i>Ynglinga tal</i> was written it had
  been forgotten that Ali was Athils' uncle, and that the war was a civil
  war. But the issue, as reported in the <i>Ynglinga tal</i> and
  <i>Ynglinga saga</i>, is the same as in <i>Beowulf</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"King Athils had great quarrels with the king called Ali of Uppland;
  he was from Norway. They had a battle on the ice of Lake Wener; there
  King Ali fell, and Athils had the victory. Concerning this battle there
  is much said in the <i>Skjoldunga saga</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>From the <i>Ynglinga saga</i> we learn more concerning King Athils:
  not always to his credit. He was, as the Swedes had been from of old, a
  great horse-breeder. Authorities differed as to whether horses or drink
  were the death of him<a name="NtA13" href="#Nt13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>.
  According to one account he brought on his end by celebrating, with
  immoderate drinking, the death of his enemy Rolf (the <i>Hrothulf</i> of
  <i>Beowulf</i>). According to another:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"King Athils was at a sacrifice of the goddesses, and rode his horse
  through the hall of the goddesses: the horse tripped under him and fell
  and threw the king; and his head smote a stone so that the skull broke
  and the brains lay on the stones, and that was his death. He died at
  Uppsala, and there was laid in mound, and the Swedes called him a mighty
  king."</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>{7}</span></p>

  <p>There can, then, hardly be a doubt that there actually was such a king
  as Eadgils: and some of the charred bones which still lie within the
  gigantic "King's mounds" at Old Uppsala may well be his<a name="NtA14"
  href="#Nt14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>. And, though they are not quite so well
  authenticated, there can also be little doubt as to the historic
  existence of Onela, Ohthere, and even of Ongentheow.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p><i>The Swedish Kings.</i></p>

  <p>The account in the <i>Ynglinga saga</i> of the fight between Onela and
  Eadgils is as follows:</p>

  <p><i>Aðils konungr átti deilur miklar við konung þann, er Áli hét inn
  upplenzki: hann var ór Nóregi. Þeir áttu orrostu á Vænis ísi; þar fell
  Áli konungr en Aðils hafði sigr; frá þessarri orrostu er langt sagt í
  Skj&#x1EB;ldunga s&#x1EB;gu.</i> (<i>Ynglinga saga</i> in
  <i>Heimskringla</i>, ed. Jónsson, Kjøbenhavn, 1893, <span
  class="scac">I</span>, 56.)</p>

  <p>The <i>Skjoldunga saga</i> here mentioned is an account of the kings
  of Denmark. It is preserved only in a Latin abstract.</p>

  <p><i>Post haec ortis inter Adilsum illum Sveciae regem et Alonem
  Opplandorum regem in Norvegia, inimicitiis, praelium utrinque indicitur:
  loco pugnae statuto in stagno Waener, glacie jam obducto. Ad illud igitur
  se viribus inferiorem agnoscens Rolphonis privigni sui opem implorat, hoc
  proposito praemio, ut ipse Rolpho tres praeciosissimas res quascunque
  optaret ex universo regno Sveciae praemii loco auferret: duodecim autem
  pugilum ipsius quilibet 3 libras auri puri, quilibet reliquorum
  bellatorum tres marcas argenti defecati. Rolpho domi ipse reses pugilos
  suos duodecim Adilso in subsidium mittit, quorum etiam opera is alioqui
  vincendus, victoriam obtinuit. Illi sibi et regi propositum praemium
  exposcunt, negat Adilsus, Rolphoni absenti ullum deberi praemium, quare

  intelligerent, reversique rem, ut gesta est, exponunt.</i> (See
  <i>Skjoldungasaga i Arngrim Jonssons Udtog, udgiven af Axel Olrik</i>,
  Kjøbenhavn, 1894, p. 34 [116].)</p>

  <p>There is also a reference to this battle on the ice in the
  <i>Kálfsvísa</i>, a mnemonic list of famous heroes and their horses. It
  is noteworthy that in this list mention is made of Vestein, who is
  perhaps the Wihstan of our poem, and of Biar, who has been thought (very
  doubtfully) to correspond to the O.E. Beaw.</p>

  <p>"Ale was on Hrafn when they rode to the ice: but another horse, a grey
  one, with Athils on his back, fell eastward, wounded by the spear." This,
  as Olrik points out, appears to refer to a version of the story in which
  Athils had his fall from his horse, not at a ceremony at Uppsala, but
  after the battle with Ali. (<i>Heltedigtning</i>, <span

  <i>etc.</i></p>

  <p><i>The Geatas.</i></p>

  <p>The identification of Geatas and Götar has been accepted by the great
  majority of scholars, although Kemble wished to locate the Geatas in
  Schleswig, Grundtvig in Gotland, and Haigh in England. Leo was the first
  to suggest the Jutes: but the "Jute-hypothesis" owes its currency to the
  arguments of Fahlbeck (<i>Beovulfsqvädet såsom källa för nordisk
  fornhistoria</i> in the <i>Antiqvarisk Tidskrift för Sverige</i>, <span
  class="scac">VIII</span>, 2, 1). Fahlbeck's very inconclusive reasons
  were contested at the time by Sarrazin (23 <i>etc.</i>) and ten Brink
  (194 <i>etc.</i>) and the arguments against them have lately been
  marshalled by H. Schück (<i>Folknamnet Geatas i den fornengelska dikten
  Beowulf</i>, Upsala, 1907). It is indeed difficult to understand how
  Fahlbeck's theory came to receive the support it has had from several
  scholars (e.g. Bugge, <i>P.B.B.</i> <span class="scac">XII</span>, 1
  <i>etc.</i>; Weyhe, <i>Engl. Stud.</i>, <span class="scac">XXXIX</span>,
  38 <i>etc.</i>; Gering). For his conclusions do not arise naturally from
  the O.E. data: his whole argument is a piece of learned pleading,
  undertaken to support his rather revolutionary speculations as to early
  Swedish history. These speculations would have been rendered less
  probable had the natural interpretation of Geatas as Götar been accepted.
  The Jute-hypothesis has recently been revived, with the greatest skill
  and learning, by Gudmund Schütte (<i>Journal of English and Germanic
  Philology</i>, <span class="scac">XI</span>, 574 <i>etc.</i>). But here
  again I cannot help suspecting that the wish is father to the thought,
  and that the fact that that eminent scholar is a Dane living in Jutland,
  has something to do with his attempt to locate the Geatas there. No
  amount of learning will eradicate patriotism.</p>

  <p>The following considerations need to be weighed:</p>

  <p>(1) <i>Geatas</i> etymologically corresponds exactly with O.N.
  <i>Gautar</i>, the modern Götar. The O.E. word corresponding to Jutes
  (the Iutae of Bede) should be, not <i>Geatas</i>, but in the Anglian
  dialect <i>Eote</i>, <i>Iote</i>, in the West Saxon <i>Iete</i>,
  <i>Yte</i>.</p>

  <p>Now it is true that in one passage in the O.E. translation of Bede
  (<span class="scac">I</span>, 15) the word "Iutarum" <i>is</i> rendered
  <i>Geata</i>: but in the other (<span class="scac">IV</span>, 16)
  "Iutorum" is rendered <i>Eota</i>, <i>Ytena</i>. And this latter
  rendering is supported (<i>a</i>) by the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>
  (<i>Iotum</i>, <i>Iutna</i>) and (<i>b</i>) by the fact that the current
  O.E. word for Jutes was <i>Yte</i>, <i>Ytan</i>, which survived till
  after the Norman conquest. For the name <i>Ytena land</i> was used for
  that portion of Hampshire which had been settled by the Jutes: William
  Rufus was slain, according to Florence of Worcester, in <i>Ytene</i>
  (which Florence explains as <i>prouincia Jutarum</i>).</p>

  <p>From the purely etymological point of view the Götar-hypothesis, then,
  is unimpeachable: but the Jute-hypothesis is unsatisfactory, since it is
  based upon one passage in the O.E. Bede, where <i>Jutarum</i> is
  incorrectly rendered <i>Geata</i>, whilst it is invalidated by the other
  passage in the O.E. Bede, by the <i>Chronicle</i> and by Florence of
  Worcester, where <i>Jutorum</i> is correctly translated by <i>Ytena</i>,
  or its Anglian or Kentish equivalent <i>Eota</i>, <i>Iotna</i>.</p>

  <p>(2) It is obvious that the Geatas of <i>Beowulf</i> were a strong and
  independent power&mdash;a match for the Swedes. Now we learn from
  Procopius that in the sixth century the Götar were an independent <!--
  Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>{9}</span>and
  numerous nation. But we have no equal evidence for any similar
  preponderant Jutish power in the sixth century. The <i>Iutae</i> are
  indeed a rather puzzling tribe, and scholars have not even been able to
  agree where they dwelt.</p>

  <p>The Götar on the other hand are located among the great nations of
  Scandinavia both by Ptolemy (<i>Geog.</i> <span class="scac">II</span>,
  11, 16) in the second century and by Procopius (<i>Bell. Gott.</i> <span
  class="scac">II</span>, 15) in the sixth. When we next get clear
  information (through the Christian missionaries) both Götar and Swedes
  have been united under one king. But the Götar retained their separate
  laws, traditions, and voice in the selection of the king, and they were
  constantly asserting themselves during the Middle Ages. The title of the
  king of Sweden, <i>rex Sveorum Gothorumque</i>, commemorates the old
  distinction.</p>

  <p>From the historical point of view, then, the Götar comply with what we
  are told in <i>Beowulf</i> of the power of the Geatas much better than do
  the Jutes.</p>

  <p>(3) Advocates of the Jute-hypothesis have claimed much support from
  the geographical argument that the Swedes and Geatas fight <i>ofer
  s&#x1E3;</i> (e.g. when Beowulf and Eadgils attack Onela, 2394). But the
  term <i>s&#x1E3;</i> is just as appropriate to the great lakes Wener and
  Wetter, which separated the Swedes from the Götar, as it is to the
  Cattegatt. And we have the evidence of Scandinavian sources that the
  battle between Eadgils and Onela actually <i>did</i> take place on the
  ice of lake Wener (see above, p. <a href="#page6">6</a>). Moreover the
  absence of any mention of ships in the fighting narrated in ll. 2922-2945
  would be remarkable if the contending nations were Jutes and Swedes, but
  suits Götar and Swedes admirably: since they could attack each other by
  land as well as by water.</p>

  <p>(4) There is reason to think that the old land of the Götar included a
  great deal of what is now the south-west coast of Sweden<a name="NtA15"
  href="#Nt15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>. Hygelac's capital was probably not far
  from the modern Göteborg. The descriptions in <i>Beowulf</i> would suit
  the cliffs of southern Sweden well, but they are quite inapplicable to
  the sandy dunes of Jutland.</p>

  <p>Little weight can, however, be attached to this last argument, as the
  cliffs of the land of the Geatas are in any case probably drawn from the
  poet's imagination.</p>

  <p>(5) If we accept the identification Beowulf = Bjarki (see below, pp.
  <a href="#page60">60</a>-1) a further argument for the equation of Geatas
  and Götar will be found in the fact that Bjarki travels to Denmark from
  Gautland just as Beowulf from the land of the Geatas; Bjarki is the
  brother of the king of the Gautar, Beowulf the nephew of the king of the
  Geatas.</p>

  <p>(6) No argument as to the meaning of <i>Geatas</i> can be drawn from
  the fact that Gregory calls Chlochilaicus (Hygelac) a Dane. For it is
  clear from <i>Beowulf</i> that, whatever else they may have been, the
  Geatas were not Danes. Either, then, Gregory must be misinformed, or he
  must be using the word <i>Dane</i> vaguely, to cover any kind of
  Scandinavian pirate.</p>

  <p>(7) Probably what has weighed most heavily (often perhaps not
  consciously) in gaining converts to the "Jute-hypothesis" has been the
  conviction that "in ancient times each nation celebrated in song its own
  heroes alone." Hence one set of scholars, accepting the identification of
  the Geatas with the Scandinavian Götar, have argued that <i>Beowulf</i>
  is therefore simply a translation from a Scandinavian Götish original.
  Others, accepting <i>Beowulf</i> as an English poem, have <!-- Page 10
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"></a>{10}</span>argued that the
  Geatas who are celebrated in it must therefore be one of the tribes that
  settled in England, and have therefore favoured the "Jute theory." But
  the <i>a priori</i> assumption that each Germanic tribe celebrated in
  song its own national heroes only is demonstrably incorrect<a
  name="NtA16" href="#Nt16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But in none of the accounts of the warfare of these Scandinavian
  kings, whether written in Norse or monkish Latin, is there mention of any
  name corresponding to that of Beowulf, as king of the Geatas. Whether he
  is as historic as the other kings with whom in our poem he is brought
  into contact, we cannot say.</p>

  <p>It has been generally held that the Beowulf of our poem is compounded
  out of two elements: that an historic Beowulf, king of the Geatas, has
  been combined with a mythological figure Beowa<a name="NtA17"
  href="#Nt17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>, a god of the ancient Angles: that the
  historical achievements against Frisians and Swedes belong to the king,
  the mythological adventures with giants and dragons to the god. But there
  is no conclusive evidence for either of these presumed component parts of
  our hero. To the god Beowa we shall have to return later: here it is
  enough to note that the current assumption that there <i>was</i> a king
  Beowulf of the Geatas lacks confirmation from Scandinavian sources.</p>

  <p>And one piece of evidence there is, which tends to show that Beowulf
  is not an historic king at all, but that his adventures have been
  violently inserted amid the historic names of the kings of the Geatas.
  Members of the families in <i>Beowulf</i> which we have reason to think
  historic bear names which alliterate the one with the other. The
  inference seems to be that it was customary, when a Scandinavian prince
  was named in the Sixth Century, to give him a name which had an initial
  letter similar to that of his father: care was thus taken that metrical
  difficulties should not prevent the names of father and son being linked
  together in song<a name="NtA18" href="#Nt18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>. In the
  case of Beowulf himself, however, this rule breaks down. Beowulf seems an
  intruder <!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page11"></a>{11}</span>into the house of Hrethel. It may be
  answered that since he was only the offspring of a daughter of that
  house, and since that daughter had three brothers, there would have been
  no prospect of his becoming king, when he was named. But neither does his
  name fit in with that of the other great house with which he is supposed
  to be connected. Wiglaf, son of Wihstan of the Wægmundingas, was named
  according to the familiar rules: but Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow, seems an
  intruder in that family as well.</p>

  <p>This failure to fall in with the alliterative scheme, and the absence
  of confirmation from external evidence, are, of course, not in themselves
  enough to prove that the reign of Beowulf over the Geatas is a poetic
  figment. And indeed our poem <i>may</i> quite possibly be true to
  historic fact in representing him as the last of the great kings of the
  Geatas; after whose death his people have nothing but national disaster
  to expect<a name="NtA19" href="#Nt19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>. It would be
  strange that this last and most mighty and magnanimous of the kings of
  the Geatas should have been forgotten in Scandinavian lands: that outside
  <i>Beowulf</i> nothing should be known of his reign. But when we consider
  how little, outside <i>Beowulf</i>, we know of the Geatic kingdom at all,
  we cannot pronounce such oblivion impossible.</p>

  <p>What tells much more against Beowulf as a historic Geatic king is that
  there is always apt to be something extravagant and unreal about what the
  poem tells us of his deeds, contrasting with the sober and historic way
  in which other kings, like Hrothgar or Hygelac or Eadgils, are referred
  to. True, we must not disqualify Beowulf forthwith because he slew a
  dragon<a name="NtA20" href="#Nt20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>. Several
  unimpeachably historical persons have done this: so sober an authority as
  the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> assures us that fiery dragons were
  flying in Northumbria as late as <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 793<a
  name="NtA21" href="#Nt21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>.</p>

<p><!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>{12}</span></p>

  <p>But (and this is the serious difficulty) even when Beowulf is depicted
  in quite historic circumstances, there is still something unsubstantial
  about his actions. When, in the midst of the strictly historical account
  of Hygelac's overthrow, we are told that Beowulf swam home bearing thirty
  suits of armour, this is as fantastic as the account of his swimming home
  from Grendel's lair with Grendel's head and the magic swordhilt. We may
  well doubt whether there is any more kernel of historic fact in the one
  feat than in the other<a name="NtA22" href="#Nt22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>.
  Again, we are told how Beowulf defended the young prince Heardred,
  Hygelac's son. Where was he, then, when Heardred was defeated and slain?
  To protect and if necessary avenge his lord upon the battlefield was the
  essential duty of the Germanic retainer. Yet Beowulf has no part to play
  in the episode of the death of Heardred. He is simply ignored till it is
  over. True, we are told that in later days he <i>did</i> take vengeance,
  by supporting the claims of Eadgils, the pretender, against Onela, the
  slayer of Heardred. But here again difficulties meet us: for the
  Scandinavian authorities, whilst they agree that Eadgils overthrew Onela
  by the use of foreign auxiliaries, represent these auxiliaries as Danish
  retainers, dispatched by the Danish king Hrothulf. The chief of these
  Danish retainers is Bothvar Bjarki, who, as we shall see later, has been
  thought to stand in some relation to Beowulf. But Bothvar is never
  regarded as king of the Geatas: and the fact remains that <i>Beowulf</i>
  is at variance with our other authorities in representing Eadgils as
  having been placed on the throne by a Geatic rather than by a Danish
  force. Yet this Geatic expedition against Onela is, with the exception of
  the dragon episode, the only event which our poem has to narrate
  concerning Beowulf's long reign of fifty years. And in other respects the
  reign is shadowy. Beowulf, we are told, came to the throne at a time of
  utter national distress; he had a long and prosperous reign, and became
  so powerful that he was able to dethrone the mighty<a name="NtA23"
  href="#Nt23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> Swedish king Onela, and place in his
  stead the miserable fugitive<a name="NtA24"
  href="#Nt24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> Eadgils. Yet, after this half century of
  success, the <!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page13"></a>{13}</span>kingdom is depicted upon Beowulf's death as
  being in the same tottering condition in which it stood at the time when
  he is represented as having come to the throne, after the fall of
  Heardred.</p>

  <p>The destruction one after the other of the descendants of Hrethel
  sounds historic: at any rate it possesses verisimilitude. But the picture
  of the childless Beowulf, dying, after a glorious reign, in extreme old
  age, having apparently made no previous arrangements for the succession,
  so that Wiglaf, a youth hitherto quite untried in war, steps at once into
  the place of command on account of his valour in slaying the
  dragon&mdash;this is a picture which lacks all historic probability.</p>

  <p>I cannot avoid a suspicion that the fifty years' reign of Beowulf over
  the Geatas may quite conceivably be a poetic fiction<a name="NtA25"
  href="#Nt25"><sup>[25]</sup></a>; that the downfall of the Geatic kingdom
  and its absorption in Sweden were very possibly brought about by the
  destruction of Hygelac and all his warriors at the mouth of the
  Rhine.</p>

  <p>Such an event would have given the Swedes their opportunity for
  vengeance: they may have swooped down, destroyed Heardred, and utterly
  crushed the independent kingdom of the Geatas before the younger
  generation had time to grow up into fighting men.</p>

  <p>To the fabulous achievements of Beowulf, his fight with Grendel,
  Grendel's dam, and the dragon, it will be necessary to return later. As
  to his other feats, all we can say is that the common assumption that
  they rest upon an historic foundation does not seem to be capable of
  proof. But that they have an historic background is indisputable.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section III. Heorot and the Danish Kings.</span></p>

  <p>Of the Danish kings mentioned in <i>Beowulf</i>, we have first Scyld
  Scefing, the foundling, an ancient and probably a mythical figure, then
  Beowulf, son of Scyld, who seems an intruder among the Danish kings,
  since the Danish records know nothing <!-- Page 14 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>{14}</span>of him, and since his
  name does not alliterate with those of either his reputed father or his
  reputed son. Then comes the "high" Healfdene, to whom four children were
  born: Heorogar, Hrothgar, Halga "the good," and a daughter who was wedded
  to the Swedish king. Since Hrothgar is represented as an elder
  contemporary of Hygelac, we must date<a name="NtA26"
  href="#Nt26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> Healfdene and his sons, should they be
  historic characters, between <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 430 and
  520.</p>

  <p>Now it is noteworthy that just after <span class="scac">A.D.</span>
  500 the Danes first become widely known, and the name "Danes" first meets
  us in Latin and Greek authors. And this cannot be explained on the ground
  that the North has become more familiar to dwellers in the classical
  lands: on the contrary far less is known concerning the geography of the
  North Sea and the Baltic than had been the case four or five centuries
  before. Tacitus and Ptolemy knew of many tribes inhabiting what is now
  Denmark, but not of the Danes: the writers in Ravenna and Constantinople
  in the sixth century, though much less well informed on the geography of
  the North, know of the Danes as amongst the most powerful nations there.
  <i>Beowulf</i> is, then, supported by the Latin and Greek records when it
  depicts these rulers of Denmark as a house of mighty kings, the fame of
  whose realm spread far and wide. We cannot tell to what extent this realm
  was made by the driving forth of alien nations from Denmark, to what
  extent by the coming together (under the common name of Danes) of many
  tribes which had hitherto been known by other distinct names.</p>

  <p>The pedigree of the house of Healfdene can be constructed from the
  references in <i>Beowulf</i>. Healfdene's three sons, Heorogar, Hrothgar,
  Halga, are presumably enumerated in order of age, since Hrothgar mentions
  Heorogar, but not Halga, as his senior<a name="NtA27"
  href="#Nt27"><sup>[27]</sup></a>. Heorogar left a son Heoroweard<a
  name="NtA28" href="#Nt28"><sup>[28]</sup></a>, but it is in accordance
  with Teutonic custom that Hrothgar should have succeeded to the throne
  if, as we may well suppose, Heoroweard was too young to be trusted with
  the kingship.</p>

<p><!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"></a>{15}</span></p>

  <p>The younger brother Halga is never mentioned during Beowulf's visit to
  Heorot, and the presumption is that he is already dead.</p>

  <p>The Hrothulf who, both in <i>Beowulf</i> and <i>Widsith</i>, is linked
  with King Hrothgar, almost as his equal, is clearly the son of Halga: for
  he is Hrothgar's nephew<a name="NtA29" href="#Nt29"><sup>[29]</sup></a>,
  and yet he is not the son of Heorogar<a name="NtA30"
  href="#Nt30"><sup>[30]</sup></a>. The mention of how Hrothgar shielded
  this Hrothulf when he was a child confirms us in the belief that his
  father Halga had died early. Yet, though he thus belongs to the youngest
  branch of the family, Hrothulf is clearly older than Hrethric and
  Hrothmund, the two sons of Hrothgar, whose youth, in spite of the age of
  their father, is striking. The seat of honour occupied by Hrothulf<a
  name="NtA31" href="#Nt31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> is contrasted with the
  undistinguished place of his two young cousins, sitting among the
  <i>giogoth</i><a name="NtA32" href="#Nt32"><sup>[32]</sup></a>.
  Nevertheless Hrothgar and his wife expect their son, not their nephew, to
  succeed to the throne<a name="NtA33" href="#Nt33"><sup>[33]</sup></a>.
  Very small acquaintance with the history of royal houses in these lawless
  Teutonic times is enough to show us that trouble is likely to be in
  store.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>So much can be made out from the English sources, <i>Beowulf</i> and
  <i>Widsith</i>. Turning now to the Scandinavian records, we find much
  confusion as to details, and as to the characters of the heroes: but the
  relationships are the same as in the Old English poem.</p>

  <p>Heorogar is, it is true, forgotten; and though a name Hiarwarus is
  found in Saxo corresponding to that of Heoroweard, the son of Heorogar,
  in <i>Beowulf</i>, this Hiarwarus is cut off from the family, now that
  his father is no longer remembered. Accordingly the Halfdan of Danish
  tradition (Haldanus in Saxo's Latin: = O.E. Healfdene) has only two sons,
  Hroar <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page16"></a>{16}</span>(Saxo's Roe, corresponding to O.E. Hrothgar)
  and Helgi (Saxo's Helgo: = O.E. Halga). Helgi is the father of Rolf Kraki
  (Saxo's Roluo: = O.E. Hrothulf), the type of the noble king, the Arthur
  of Denmark.</p>

  <p>And, just as Arthur holds court at Camelot, or Charlemagne is at home
  <i>ad Ais, à sa capele</i>, so the Scandinavian traditions represent Rolf
  Kraki as keeping house at Leire (<i>Lethra</i>, <i>Hleiðar
  garðr</i>).</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Accounts of all these kings, and above all of Rolf Kraki, meet us in a
  number of Scandinavian documents, of which three are particularly
  important:</p>

  <p>(1) Saxo Grammaticus (the lettered), the earlier books of whose
  <i>Historia Danica</i> are a storehouse of Scandinavian tradition and
  poetry, clothed in a difficult and bombastic, but always amusing, Latin.
  How much later than the English these Scandinavian sources are, we can
  realize by remembering that when Saxo was putting the finishing touches
  to his history, King John was ruling in England.</p>

  <p>There are also a number of other Danish-Latin histories and
  genealogies.</p>

  <p>(2) The Icelandic <i>Saga of Rolf Kraki</i>, a late document belonging

<hr class="short" />

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section IV. Leire and Heorot.</span></p>

  <p>The village of Leire remains to the present day. It stands near the
  north coast of the island of Seeland, some five miles from Roskilde and
  three miles from the sea, in a gentle valley, through the midst of which
  flows a small stream. The village itself consists of a tiny cluster of
  cottages: the outstanding feature of the place is formed by the huge
  grave mounds scattered around in all directions.</p>

  <p>The tourist, walking amid these cottages and mounds, may feel fairly
  confident that he is standing on the site of Heorot.</p>

  <p>There are two distinct stages in this identification: it must be
  proved (<i>a</i>) that the modern Leire occupies the site of the Leire
  (<i>Lethra</i>) where Rolf Kraki ruled, and (<i>b</i>) that the Leire of
  Rolf Kraki was built on the site of Heorot.</p>

    Leire in the Seventeenth Century

    <p class="cenhead">From Saxo Grammaticus, ed. Stephanius, 1644.</p>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"></a>{17}</span></p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) That the modern Leire occupies the site of the ancient
  Leire has indeed been disputed<a name="NtA34"
  href="#Nt34"><sup>[34]</sup></a>, but seems hardly open to doubt, in view
  of the express words of the Danish chroniclers<a name="NtA35"
  href="#Nt35"><sup>[35]</sup></a>. It is true that the mounds, which these
  early chroniclers probably imagined as covering the ashes of 'Haldanus'
  or 'Roe,' and which later antiquaries dubbed with the names of other
  kings, are now thought to belong, not to the time of Hrothgar, but to the
  Stone or Bronze Ages. But this evidence that Leire was a place of
  importance thousands of years before Hrothgar or Hrothulf were born, in
  no wise invalidates the overwhelming evidence that it was their residence
  also.</p>

  <p>The equation of the modern Leire with the Leire of Rolf Kraki we may
  then accept. We cannot be quite so sure of our thesis (<i>b</i>): that
  the ancient Leire was identical with the site where Hrothgar built
  Heorot. But it is highly probable: for although Leire is more
  particularly connected with the memory of Rolf Kraki himself, we are
  assured, in one of the mediæval Danish chronicles, that Leire was the
  royal seat of Rolf's predecessors as well: of Ro (Hrothgar) and of Ro's
  father: and that Ro "enriched it with great magnificence<a name="NtA36"
  href="#Nt36"><sup>[36]</sup></a>." Ro also, according to this chronicler,
  heaped a mound at Leire over the grave of his father, and was himself
  buried at Leire under another mound.</p>

  <p>Now since the Danish tradition represents Hrothgar as enriching his
  royal town of Leire, whilst English tradition commemorates him as a
  builder king, constructing a royal hall "greater than the sons of men had
  ever heard speak of"&mdash;it becomes very probable that the two
  traditions are reflections of the same fact, and that the site of that
  hall was Leire. That Heorot, the picturesque name of the hall itself,
  should, in English tradition, have been remembered, whilst that of the
  town where it was built had been forgotten, is natural<a name="NtA37"
  href="#Nt37"><sup>[37]</sup></a>. For <!-- Page 18 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page18"></a>{18}</span>though the names of
  heroes survived in such numbers, after the settlement of the Angles in
  England, it was very rarely indeed, so far as we can judge, that the
  Angles and Saxons continued to have any clear idea concerning the
  <i>places</i> which had been familiar to their forefathers, but which
  they themselves had never seen.</p>

  <p>Further, the names of both Hrothgar and Hrothulf are linked with
  Heorot in English tradition in the same way as those of Roe and Rolf are
  with Leire in Danish chronicles.</p>

  <p>Yet there is some little doubt, though not such as need seriously
  trouble us, as to this identification of the site of Heorot with Leire.
  Two causes especially have led students to doubt the connection of Roe
  (Hrothgar) with Leire, and to place elsewhere the great hall Heorot which
  he built.</p>

  <p>In the first place, Rolf Kraki came to be so intimately associated
  with Leire that his connection overshadowed that of Roe, and Saxo even
  goes so far in one place as to represent Leire as having been
  <i>founded</i> by Rolf<a name="NtA38" href="#Nt38"><sup>[38]</sup></a>.
  In that case Leire clearly could not be the place where Rolf's
  predecessor built his royal hall. But that Saxo is in error here seems
  clear, for elsewhere he himself speaks of Leire as being a Danish
  stronghold when Rolf was a child<a name="NtA39"
  href="#Nt39"><sup>[39]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>In the second place, Roe is credited with having founded the
  neighbouring town of Roskilde (Roe's spring)<a name="NtA40"
  href="#Nt40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> so that some have wished to locate
  Heorot there, rather than at Leire, five miles to the west. But against
  this identification of Heorot with Roskilde it must be noted that Roe is
  said to have built Roskilde, not as a capital for himself, but as a
  market-place for the merchants: there is no suggestion that it was his
  royal town, though in time it became the capital, and its cathedral is
  still the Westminster Abbey of Denmark.</p>

  <p>What at first sight looks so much in favour of our equating <!-- Page
  19 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"></a>{19}</span>Roskilde with
  Heorot&mdash;the presence in its name of the element <i>Ro</i>
  (Hrothgar)&mdash;is in reality the most suspicious thing about the
  identification. There are other names in Denmark with the element
  <i>Ro</i>, in places where it is quite impossible to suppose that the
  king's name is commemorated. Some other explanation of the name has
  therefore to be sought, and it is very probable that Roskilde meant
  originally not "Hrothgar's spring," but "the horses' spring," and that
  the connection with King Ro is simply one of those inevitable pieces of
  popular etymology which take place so soon as the true origin of a name
  is forgotten<a name="NtA41" href="#Nt41"><sup>[41]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Leire has, then, a much better claim than Roskilde to being the site
  of Heorot: and geographical considerations confirm this. For Heorot is
  clearly imagined by the poet of <i>Beowulf</i> as being some distance
  inland; and this, whilst it suits admirably the position of Leire, is
  quite inapplicable to Roskilde, which is situated on the sea at the head
  of the Roskilde fjord<a name="NtA42" href="#Nt42"><sup>[42]</sup></a>. Of
  course we must not expect to find the poet of <i>Beowulf</i>, or indeed
  any epic poet, minutely exact in his geography. At the same time it is
  clear that at the time <i>Beowulf</i> was written there were traditions
  extant, dealing with the attack made upon Heorot by the ancestral foes of
  the Danes, a tribe called the Heathobeardan. These accounts of the
  fighting around Heorot must have preserved the general impression of its
  situation, precisely as from the <i>Iliad</i> we know that Troy is
  neither on the sea nor yet very remote from it. A poet would draw on his
  imagination for details, but would hardly alter a feature like this.</p>

  <p>In these matters absolute certainty cannot be reached: but we may be
  fairly sure that the spot where Hrothgar built his "Hart-Hall" and where
  Hrothulf held that court to which the North ever after looked for its
  pattern of chivalry was <!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page20"></a>{20}</span>Leire, where the grave mounds rise out of
  the waving cornfields<a name="NtA43"
  href="#Nt43"><sup>[43]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section V. The Heathobeardan.</span></p>

  <p>Now, as <i>Beowulf</i> is the one long Old English poem which happens
  to have been preserved, we, drawing our ideas of Old English story almost
  exclusively from it, naturally think of Heorot as the scene of the fight
  with Grendel.</p>

  <p>But in the short poem of <i>Widsith</i>, almost certainly older than
  <i>Beowulf</i>, we have a catalogue of the characters of the Old English
  heroic poetry. This catalogue is dry in itself, but is of the greatest
  interest for the light it throws upon Old Germanic heroic legends and the
  history behind them. And from <i>Widsith</i> it is clear that the rule of
  Hrothgar and Hrothulf at Heorot and the attack of the Heathobeardan upon
  them, rather than any story of monster-quelling, was what the old poets
  more particularly associated with the name of Heorot. The passage in
  <i>Widsith</i> runs:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"For a very long time did Hrothgar and Hrothwulf, uncle and nephew,
  hold the peace together, after they had driven away the race of the
  Vikings and humbled the array of Ingeld, had hewed down at Heorot the
  host of the Heathobeardan."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The details of this war can be reconstructed, partly from the
  allusions in <i>Beowulf</i>, partly from the Scandinavian accounts. The
  Scandinavian versions are less primitive and historic. They have
  forgotten all about the Heathobeardan as an independent tribe, and,
  whilst remembering the names of the leading chieftains on both sides,
  they see in them members of two rival branches of the Danish royal
  house.</p>

  <p>We gather from <i>Beowulf</i> that for generations a blood feud has
  raged between the Danes and the Heathobeardan. Nothing is told us in
  <i>Beowulf</i> about the king Healfdene, except that he <!-- Page 21
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"></a>{21}</span>was fierce in
  war and that he lived to be old. From the Scandinavian stories it seems
  clear that he was concerned in the Heathobard feud. According to some
  later Scandinavian accounts he was slain by Frothi (=Froda, whom we know
  from <i>Beowulf</i> to have been king of the Heathobeardan) and this may
  well have been the historic fact<a name="NtA44"
  href="#Nt44"><sup>[44]</sup></a>. How Hroar and Helgi (Hrothgar and
  Halga), the sons of Halfdan (Healfdene), evaded the pursuit of Frothi, we
  learn from the Scandinavian tales; whether the Old English story knew
  anything of their hair-breadth escapes we cannot tell. Ultimately, the
  saga tells us, Hroar and Helgi, in revenge for their father's death,
  burnt the hall over the head of his slayer, Frothi<a name="NtA45"
  href="#Nt45"><sup>[45]</sup></a>. To judge from the hints in
  <i>Beowulf</i>, it would rather seem that the Old English tradition
  represented this vengeance upon Froda as having been inflicted in a
  pitched battle. The eldest brother Heorogar&mdash;known only to the
  English story&mdash;perhaps took his share in this feat. But, after his
  brothers Heorogar and Halga were dead, Hrothgar, left alone, and fearing
  vengeance in his turn, strove to compose the feud by wedding his daughter
  Freawaru to Ingeld, the son of Froda. So much we learn from the report
  which Beowulf gives, on his return home, to Hygelac, as to the state of
  things at the Danish court.</p>

  <p>Beowulf is depicted as carrying a very sage head upon his young
  shoulders, and he gives evidence of his astuteness by predicting<a
  name="NtA46" href="#Nt46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> that the peace which
  Hrothgar has purchased will not be lasting. Some Heathobard survivor of
  the fight in which Froda fell, will, he thinks, see a young Dane in the
  retinue of Freawaru proudly pacing the hall, wearing the treasures which
  his father had won from the Heathobeardan. Then the old warrior will urge
  on his younger comrade "Canst thou, my lord, tell the sword, the dear
  iron, which thy father carried to the fight when he bore helm for the
  last time, when the Danes slew him and had the victory? And now the son
  <!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"></a>{22}</span>of
  one of these slayers paces the hall, proud of his arms, boasts of the
  slaughter and wears the precious sword which thou by right shouldst
  wield<a name="NtA47" href="#Nt47"><sup>[47]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p>Such a reminder as this no Germanic warrior could long resist. So,
  Beowulf thinks, the young Dane will be slain; Ingeld will cease to take
  joy in his bride; and the old feud will break out afresh.</p>

  <p>That it did so we know from <i>Widsith</i>, and from the same source
  we know that this Heathobard attack was repulsed by the combined strength
  of Hrothgar and his nephew Hrothulf.</p>

  <p>But the tragic figure of Ingeld, hesitating between love for his
  father and love for his wife, between the duty of vengeance and his
  plighted word, was one which was sure to attract the interest of the old
  heroic poets more even than those of the victorious uncle and nephew. In
  the eighth century Alcuin, the Northumbrian, quotes Ingeld as the typical
  hero of song. Writing to a bishop of Lindisfarne, he reproves the monks
  for their fondness for the old stories about heathen kings, who are now
  lamenting their sins in Hell: "in the Refectory," he says, "the Bible
  should be read: the lector heard, not the harper: patristic sermons
  rather than pagan songs. For what has Ingeld to do with Christ<a
  name="NtA48" href="#Nt48"><sup>[48]</sup></a>?" This protest testifies
  eloquently to the popularity of the Ingeld story, and further evidence is
  possibly afforded by the fact that few heroes of story seem to have had
  so many namesakes in Eighth Century England.</p>

  <p>What is emphasized in <i>Beowulf</i> is not so much the struggle in
  the mind of Ingeld as the stern, unforgiving temper of the grim old
  warrior who will not let the feud die down; and this is the case also
  with the Danish versions, preserved to us in the Latin of Saxo
  Grammaticus. In two songs (translated by Saxo into "delightful sapphics")
  the old warrior Starcatherus stirs up Ingellus to his revenge:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Why, Ingeld, buried in vice, dost thou delay to avenge thy father?
  Wilt thou endure patiently the slaughter of thy righteous sire?...</p>

<p><!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>{23}</span></p>

  <p>Whilst thou takest pleasure in honouring thy bride, laden with gems,
  and bright with golden vestments, grief torments us, coupled with shame,
  as we bewail thine infamies.</p>

  <p>Whilst headlong lust urges thee, our troubled mind recalls the fashion
  of an earlier day, and admonishes us to grieve over many things.</p>

  <p>For we reckon otherwise than thou the crime of the foes, whom now thou
  holdest in honour; wherefore the face of this age is a burden to me, who
  have known the old ways.</p>

  <p>By nought more would I desire to be blessed, if, Froda, I might see
  those guilty of thy murder paying the due penalty of such a crime<a
  name="NtA49" href="#Nt49"><sup>[49]</sup></a>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Starkath came to be one of the best-known figures in Scandinavian
  legend, the type of the fierce, unrelenting warrior. Even in death his
  severed head bit the earth: or according to another version "the trunk
  fought on when the head was gone<a name="NtA50"
  href="#Nt50"><sup>[50]</sup></a>." Nor did the Northern imagination leave
  him there. It loved to follow him below, and to indulge in conjectures as
  to his bearing in the pit of Hell<a name="NtA51"

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Who the Heathobeardan were is uncertain. It is frequently argued that
  they are identical with the Longobardi; that the words <i>Heatho-Bard</i>
  and <i>Long-Bard</i> correspond, just as we get sometimes
  <i>Gar-Dene</i>, sometimes <i>Hring-Dene</i>. (So Heyne; Bremer in
  <i>Pauls Grdr.</i> (2) <span class="scac">III</span>, 949 <i>etc.</i>)
  The evidence for this is however unsatisfactory (see Chambers,
  <i>Widsith</i>, 205). Since the year 186 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>
  onwards the Longobardi were dwelling far inland, and were certainly never
  in a position from which an attack upon the Danes would have been
  practicable. If, therefore, we accept the identification of Heatho-Bard
  and Long-Bard, we must suppose the Heathobeardan of <i>Beowulf</i> to
  have been not the Longobardi of history, but a separate portion of the
  people, which had been left behind on the shores of the Baltic, when the
  main body went south. But as we have no evidence for any such offshoot
  from the main tribe, it is misleading to speak of the Heathobeardan as
  identical with the Longobardi: and although the similarity of one element
  in the name suggests some primitive relationship, that relationship may
  well have been exceedingly remote<a name="NtA52"
  href="#Nt52"><sup>[52]</sup></a>.</p>

<p><!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"></a>{24}</span></p>

  <p>It has further been proposed to identify the Heathobeardan with the
  Heruli<a name="NtA53" href="#Nt53"><sup>[53]</sup></a>. The Heruli came
  from the Scandinavian district, overran Europe, and became famous for
  their valour, savagery, and value as light-armed troops. If the
  Heathobeardan are identical with the Heruli, and if what we are told of
  the customs of the Heruli is true, Freawaru was certainly to be pitied.
  The Heruli were accustomed to put to death their sick and aged: and to
  compel widows to commit suicide.</p>

  <p>The supposed identity of the Heruli with the Heathobeardan is however
  very doubtful. It rests solely upon the statement of Jordanes that they
  had been driven from their homes by the Danes (<i>Dani ... Herulos
  propriis sedibus expulerunt</i>). This is inconclusive, since the growth
  of the Danish power is likely enough to have led to collisions with more
  than one tribe. In fact <i>Beowulf</i> tells us that Scyld "tore away the
  mead benches from <i>many</i> a people." On the other hand the
  dissimilarity of names is not conclusive evidence against the
  identification, for the word <i>Heruli</i> is pretty certainly the same
  as the Old English <i>Eorlas</i>, and is a complimentary nick-name
  applied by the tribe to themselves, rather than their original racial
  designation.</p>

  <p>Nothing, then, is really known of the Heathobeardan, except that
  evidence points to their having dwelt somewhere on the Baltic<a
  name="NtA54" href="#Nt54"><sup>[54]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The Scandinavian sources which have preserved the memory of this feud
  have transformed it in an extraordinary way. The Heathobeardan came to be
  quite forgotten, although maybe some trace of their name remains in
  <i>Hothbrodd</i>, who is represented as the foe of Roe (Hrothgar) and
  Rolf (Hrothulf). When the Heathobeardan were forgotten, Froda and Ingeld
  were left without any subjects, and naturally came to be regarded, like
  Healfdene and the other kings with whom they were associated in story, as
  Danish kings. Accordingly the tale developed in Scandinavian lands in two
  ways. Some documents, and especially the Icelandic ones<a name="NtA55"
  href="#Nt55"><sup>[55]</sup></a>, represent the struggle as a feud
  between two branches of the Danish royal house. Even here there is no
  agreement who is the usurper and who the victim, so that sometimes it is
  Froda and sometimes Healfdene who is represented as the traitor and
  murderer.</p>

  <p>But another version<a name="NtA56"
  href="#Nt56"><sup>[56]</sup></a>&mdash;the Danish&mdash;whilst making
  Froda and Ingeld into Danish kings, separates their story altogether from
  that of Healfdene and his house: in this version the quarrel is still
  thought of as being between two nations, not as between the rightful heir
  to the throne and a treacherous and relentless usurper. Accordingly the
  feud is such as may be, at any rate temporarily, laid aside: peace
  between the contending parties is not out of the question. This version
  therefore preserves much more of the original character of the story, for
  it remains the tale of a young prince who, willing to marry into the
  house of his ancestral foes and to forgive and forget the old feud, is
  stirred by his more unrelenting henchman into taking vengeance for his
  father. But, owing to the prince having come to be represented as a Dane,
  patriotic reasons have suggested to the <!-- Page 25 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page25"></a>{25}</span>Danish poets and
  historians a quite different conclusion to the story. Instead of being
  routed, Ingeld, in Saxo, is successful in his revenge.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section VI. Hrothulf.</span></p>

  <p>Yet, although the Icelandic sources are wrong in representing Froda
  and Ingeld as Danes, they are not altogether wrong in representing the
  Danish royal house as divided against itself. Only they fail to place the
  blame where it really lay. For none of the Scandinavian sources attribute
  any act of injustice or usurpation to Rolf Kraki. He is the ideal king,
  and his title to the throne is not supposed to be doubtful.</p>

  <p>Yet we saw that, in <i>Beowulf</i>, the position of Hrothulf is
  represented as an ambiguous one<a name="NtA57"
  href="#Nt57"><sup>[57]</sup></a>, he is the king's too powerful nephew,
  whose claims may prejudice those of his less distinguished young cousins,
  the king's sons, and the speech of queen Wealhtheow is heavy with
  foreboding. "I know," she says, "that my gracious Hrothulf will support
  the young princes in honour, if thou, King of the Scyldings, shouldst
  leave the world sooner than he. I ween that he will requite our children,
  if he remembers all which we two have done for his pleasure and honour,
  being yet a child<a name="NtA58" href="#Nt58"><sup>[58]</sup></a>."
  Whilst Hrethric and Hrothmund, the sons of King Hrothgar, have to sit
  with the juniors, the <i>giogoth</i><a name="NtA59"
  href="#Nt59"><sup>[59]</sup></a>, Hrothulf is a man of tried valour, who
  sits side by side with the king: "where the two good ones sat, uncle and
  nephew: <i>as yet</i> was there peace between them, and each was true to
  the other<a name="NtA60" href="#Nt60"><sup>[60]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p>Again we have mention of "Hrothgar and Hrothulf. Heorot was filled
  full of friends: <i>at that time</i> the mighty Scylding folk in no wise
  worked treachery<a name="NtA61" href="#Nt61"><sup>[61]</sup></a>."
  Similarly in <i>Widsith</i> the mention of Hrothgar and Hrothulf together
  seems to stir the poet to dark sayings. "<i>For a very long time</i> did
  Hrothgar and Hrothulf, uncle and nephew, hold the peace together<a
  name="NtA62" href="#Nt62"><sup>[62]</sup></a>."</p>

<p><!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"></a>{26}</span></p>

  <p>The statement that "as yet" or "for a very long time" or "at that
  time" there was peace within the family, necessarily implies that, at
  last, the peace <i>was</i> broken, that Hrothulf quarrelled with
  Hrothgar, or strove to set aside his sons<a name="NtA63"
  href="#Nt63"><sup>[63]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Further evidence is hardly needed; yet further evidence we have: by
  rather complicated, but quite unforced, fitting together of various
  Scandinavian authorities, we find that Hrothulf deposed and slew his
  cousin Hrethric.</p>

  <p>Saxo Grammaticus tells us how Roluo (Rolf = O.N. Hrolfr, O.E.
  Hrothulf) slew a certain Røricus (or Hrærek = O.E. Hrethric) and gave to
  his own followers all the plunder which he found in the city of Røricus.
  Saxo is here translating an older authority, the <i>Bjarkamál</i> (now
  lost), and he did not know who Røricus was: he certainly did not regard
  him as a son or successor of Roe (Hrothgar) or as a cousin of Roluo
  (Hrothulf). "Roluo, who laid low Røricus <i>the son of the covetous
  Bøkus</i>" is Saxo's phrase (<i>qui natum Bøki Røricum stravit
  avari</i>). This would be a translation of some such phrase in the
  <i>Bjarkamál</i> as <i>Hræreks bani hnøggvanbauga</i>, "the slayer of
  Hrærek Hnoggvanbaugi<a name="NtA64"
  href="#Nt64"><sup>[64]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p>But, when we turn to the genealogy of the Danish kings<a name="NtA65"
  href="#Nt65"><sup>[65]</sup></a>, we actually find a <i>Hrærekr
  Hnauggvanbaugi</i> given as a king of Denmark about the time of Roluo.
  This <i>Røricus</i> or <i>Hrærekr</i> who was slain by Roluo was then,
  himself, a king of the Danes, and must, therefore, have preceded Roluo on
  the throne. But in that case Røricus <i>must</i> be son of Roe, and
  identical with his namesake Hrethric, the son of Hrothgar, in
  <i>Beowulf</i>. For no one but a son of King Roe could have had such a
  claim to the throne as to rule between that king and his all powerful
  nephew Roluo<a href="#Nt65"><sup>[65]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>It is difficult, perhaps, to state this argument in a way which will
  be convincing to those who are not acquainted with Saxo's method of
  working. To those who realize how he treats <!-- Page 27 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page27"></a>{27}</span>his sources, it will be
  clear that Røricus is the son of Roe, and is slain by Roluo. Translating
  the words into their Old English equivalents, Hrethric, son of Hrothgar,
  is slain by Hrothulf.</p>

  <p>The forebodings of Wealhtheow were justified.</p>

  <p>Hrethric is then almost certainly an actual historic prince who was
  thrust from the throne by Hrothulf. Of Hrothmund<a name="NtA66"
  href="#Nt66"><sup>[66]</sup></a>, his brother, Scandinavian authorities
  seem to know nothing. He is very likely a poetical fiction, a duplicate
  of Hrethric. For it is very natural that in story the princes whose lives
  are threatened by powerful usurpers should go in pairs. Hrethric and
  Hrothmund go together like Malcolm and Donalbain. Their helplessness is
  thus emphasized over against the one mighty figure, Rolf or Macbeth,
  threatening them<a name="NtA67" href="#Nt67"><sup>[67]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Yet this does not prove Hrothmund unhistoric. On the contrary it may
  well happen that the facts of history will coincide with the demands of
  well-ordered narrative, as was the case when Richard of Gloucester
  murdered <i>two</i> young princes in the Tower.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Two other characters, who meet us in <i>Beowulf</i>, seem to have some
  part to play in this tragedy.</p>

  <p>It was a maxim of the old Teutonic poetry, as it is of the British
  Constitution, that the king could do no wrong: the real fault lay with
  the adviser. If Ermanaric the Goth slew his wife and his son, or if
  Irminfrid the Thuringian unwisely challenged Theodoric the Frank to
  battle, this was never supposed to be due solely to the recklessness of
  the monarch himself&mdash;it was the work of an evil counsellor&mdash;a
  Bikki or an Iring. Now we have seen that there is mischief brewing in
  Heorot&mdash;and we are introduced to a counsellor Unferth, the
  <i>thyle</i> or official spokesman and adviser of King Hrothgar. And
  Unferth is evil. His jealous temper is shown by the hostile and
  inhospitable reception which he gives to Beowulf. And Beowulf's reply
  gives us a hint of some darker stain: "though <!-- Page 28 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>{28}</span>thou hast been the slayer
  of thine own brethren&mdash;thy flesh and blood: for that thou shalt
  suffer damnation in hell, good though thy wit may be<a name="NtA68"
  href="#Nt68"><sup>[68]</sup></a>." One might perhaps think that Beowulf
  in these words was only giving the "countercheck quarrelsome," and
  indulging in mere reckless abuse, just as Sinfjotli (the Fitela of
  <i>Beowulf</i>) in the <i>First Helgi Lay</i> hurls at his foes all kinds
  of outrageous charges assuredly not meant to be taken literally. But, as
  we learn from the <i>Helgi Lay</i> itself, the uttering of such unfounded
  taunts was not considered good form; whilst it seems pretty clear that
  the speech of Beowulf to Unferth is intended as an example of justifiable
  and spirited self-defence, not, like the speech of Sinfjotli, as a
  storehouse of things which a well-mannered warrior should <i>not</i>
  say.</p>

  <p>Besides, the taunt of Beowulf is confirmed, although but darkly, by
  the poet himself, in the same passage in which he has recorded the fears
  of Wealhtheow lest perhaps Hrothulf should not be loyal to Hrothgar and
  his issue: "Likewise there Unferth the counsellor sat at the foot of the
  lord of the Scyldingas: each of them [i.e. both Hrothgar and Hrothulf]
  trusted to his spirit: that his courage was great, <i>though he had not
  done his duty by his kinsmen at the sword-play</i><a name="NtA69"
  href="#Nt69"><sup>[69]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p>But, granting that Unferth has really been the cause of the death of
  his kinsmen, some scholars have doubted whether we are to suppose that he
  literally slew them himself. For, had that been the case, they urge, he
  could not be occupying a place of trust with the almost ideal king
  Hrothgar. But the record of the historians makes it quite clear that
  murder of kin did happen, and that constantly<a name="NtA70"
  href="#Nt70"><sup>[70]</sup></a>. Amid the tragic complexities of heroic
  life it often could not be avoided. The <i>comitatus</i>-system, by which
  a man was expected to give unflinching support to any chief whose service
  he had entered, must often have resulted in slaughter between men united
  by very close bonds of kin or friendship. Turning from history to saga,
  we find some of the greatest heroes not free from the stain. Sigmund,
  <!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page29"></a>{29}</span>Gunnar, Hogni, Atli, Hrothulf, Heoroweard,
  Hnæf, Eadgils, Hæthcyn, Ermanaric and Hildebrand were all marred with
  this taint, and indeed were, in many cases, rather to be pitied than
  blamed. I doubt, therefore, whether we need try and save Unferth's
  character by suggesting that the stern words of the poet mean only that
  he had indirectly caused the death of his brethren by failing them, in
  battle, at some critical moment<a name="NtA71"
  href="#Nt71"><sup>[71]</sup></a>. I suspect that this, involving
  cowardice or incompetence, would have been held the more unpardonable
  offence, and <i>would</i> have resulted in Unferth's disgrace. But a man
  might well have slain his kin under circumstances which, while leaving a
  blot on his record, did not necessitate his banishment from good society.
  All the same, the poet evidently thinks it a weakness on the part of
  Hrothgar and Hrothulf that, after what has happened, they still put their
  trust in Unferth.</p>

  <p>Here then is the situation. The king has a counsellor: that counsellor
  is evil. Both the king and his nephew trust the evil counsellor. A bitter
  feud springs up between the king and his nephew. That the feud was due to
  the machinations of the evil adviser can hardly be doubted by those who
  have studied the ways of the old Germanic heroic story. But it is only an
  inference: positive proof we have none.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Lastly, there is Heoroweard. Of him we are told in <i>Beowulf</i> very
  little. He is son of Heorogar (or Heregar), Hrothgar's elder brother, who
  was apparently king before him, but died young<a name="NtA72"
  href="#Nt72"><sup>[72]</sup></a>. It is quite natural, as we have seen,
  that, if Heoroweard was too young for the responsibility when his father
  died, he should not have succeeded to the throne. What is not so natural
  is that he does not inherit his father's arms, which one might reasonably
  have supposed Hrothgar would have preserved, to give to him when he came
  of age. Instead, Hrothgar gives them to Beowulf<a name="NtA73"
  href="#Nt73"><sup>[73]</sup></a>. Does Hrothgar deliberately avoid doing
  honour to Heoroweard, because he fears that any distinction conferred
  upon him would strengthen a rival <!-- Page 30 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>{30}</span>whose claims to the
  throne might endanger those of his own sons? However this may be, in any
  future struggle for the throne Heoroweard may reasonably be expected to
  play some part.</p>

  <p>Turning now to Saxo, and to the <i>Saga of Rolf Kraki</i>, we find
  that Rolf owed his death to the treachery of one whose name corresponds
  exactly to that of Heoroweard&mdash;Hiarwarus (Saxo), Hj&#x1EB;rvarthr
  (<i>Saga</i>). Neither Saxo nor the <i>Saga</i> thinks of Hiarwarus as
  the cousin of Rolf Kraki: they do not make it really clear <i>what</i>
  the cause of his enmity was. But they tell us that, after a banquet, he
  and his men treacherously rose upon Rolf and his warriors. The defence
  which Rolf and his men put up in their burning hall: the loyalty and
  defiance of Rolf's champions, invincible in death&mdash;these were
  amongst the most famous things of the North; they were told in the
  <i>Bjarkamál</i>, now unfortunately extant in Saxo's paraphrase only.</p>

  <p>But the triumph of Hiarwarus was brief. Rolf's men all fell around
  him, save the young Wiggo, who had previously, in the confidence of
  youth, boasted that, should Rolf fall, he would avenge him. Astonished at
  the loyalty of Rolf's champions, Hiarwarus expressed regret that none had
  taken quarter, declaring that he would gladly accept the service of such
  men. Whereupon Wiggo came from the hiding-place where he had taken
  refuge, and offered to do homage to Hiarwarus, by placing his hand on the
  hilt of his new lord's sword: but in doing so he drove the point through
  Hiarwarus, and rejoiced as he received his death from the attendants of
  the foe he had slain. It shows how entirely the duty of vengeance was
  felt to outweigh all other considerations, that this treacherous act of
  Wiggo is always spoken of with the highest praise.</p>

  bad character of Unferth has its part to play: "It is a <i>weakness</i>
  in Hrothgar that he entrusts important office to such a man&mdash;a <!--
  Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"></a>{31}</span>weakness

  <p>These views have been disputed by Miss Clarke (<i>Sidelights</i>,

<hr class="short" />

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section VII. King Offa.</span></p>

  <p>The poem, then, is mainly concerned with the deeds of Geatic and
  Danish kings: only once is reference made to a king of Anglian
  stock&mdash;Offa.</p>

  <p>The <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> tells us of several kings named Offa,
  but two only concern us here. Still remembered is the historic
  tyrant-king who reigned over Mercia during the latter half of the eighth
  century, and who was celebrated through the Middle Ages chiefly as the
  founder of the great abbey of St Albans. This Offa is sometimes referred
  to as Offa <i>the Second</i>, because he had a remote ancestor, Offa I,
  who, if the Mercian pedigree can be trusted, lived twelve generations
  earlier, and therefore presumably in the latter half of the fourth
  century. Offa I, then, must have ruled over the Angles whilst they were
  still dwelling in Angel, their continental home, in or near the modern
  Schleswig.</p>

  <p>Now the Offa mentioned in <i>Beowulf</i> is spoken of as related to
  Garmund and Eomer (<span class="scac">MS</span> <i>geomor</i>). This,
  apart from the abundant further evidence, is sufficient to identify him
  with Offa I, who was, according to the pedigree, the son of Wærmund and
  the grandfather of Eomer.</p>

  <p>This Offa I, king of Angel, is referred to in <i>Widsith</i>.
  <i>Widsith</i> is a composite poem: the passage concerning Offa, though
  not the most obviously primitive portion of it, is, nevertheless, early:
  it may well be earlier than <i>Beowulf</i>. After a list of famous
  chieftains we are told:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Offa ruled Angel, Alewih the Danes; he was the boldest of all these
  men, yet did he not in his deeds of valour surpass Offa. But Offa gained,
  first of men, by arms the greatest of kingdoms whilst yet a boy; no one
  of equal age ever did greater deeds of valour in battle with his single
  sword: he drew the boundary against the Myrgingas at Fifeldor. The
  boundaries were held afterwards by the Angles and the Swæfe as Offa
  struck it out.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"></a>{32}</span></p>

  <p>Much is obscure here: more particularly our ignorance as to the
  Myrgingas is to be regretted: but there is reason for thinking that they
  were a people dwelling to the south of the old continental home of the
  Angles.</p>

  <p>After the lapse of some five centuries, we get abundant further
  information concerning Offa. The legends about him, though carried to
  England by the Anglian conquerors, must also have survived in the
  neighbourhood of his old kingdom of Angel: for as Angel was incorporated
  into the Danish kingdom, so these stories became part of the stock of
  Danish national legend. Offa came to be regarded as a Danish king, and
  his story is told at length by the two earliest historians of Denmark,
  Sweyn Aageson and Saxo Grammaticus. In Saxo the story runs thus:</p>

  <p>Wermund, king of Denmark, had a son Uffo [Offa], tall beyond the
  measure of his age, but dull and speechless. When Wermund grew blind, his
  southern neighbour, the king of Saxony, laid claim to Denmark on the
  ground that he was no longer fit to rule, and, relying upon Uffo's
  incapacity, suggested that the quarrel should be decided by their two
  sons in single combat. Wermund, in despair, offered himself to fight, in
  spite of his blindness: this offer the envoys of the Saxon king refused
  with insult, and the Danes knew not what to say. Thereupon Uffo, who
  happened to be present, suddenly asked leave to speak. Wermund could not
  believe that it was really his son who had spoken, but when they all
  assured him that it <i>was</i>, he gave the permission. "In vain," then
  said Uffo, "does the king of Saxony covet the land of Denmark, which
  trusts to its true king and its brave nobles: neither is a son wanting to
  the king nor a successor to the kingdom." And he offered to fight not
  only the Saxon prince, but any chosen champion the prince might bring
  with him.</p>

  <p>The Saxon envoys accepted the offer and departed. The blind king was
  at last convinced, by passing his hands over him, that the speaker had
  been in truth his son. But it was found difficult to arm him; for his
  broad chest split the rings of every coat of mail: the largest, his
  father's, had to be cleft down the side and fastened with a clasp.
  Likewise no sword <!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page33"></a>{33}</span>was so well tempered that he did not shatter
  it by merely brandishing it, till the old king directed his men how they
  might find his ancient sword, <i>Skrep</i> (= ? stedfast) which he had
  buried, in despair, thinking his son unworthy of it. The sword, when
  found, was so frail from age that Uffo did not test it: for Wermund told
  him that, if he broke it, there was no other left strong enough for
  him.</p>

  <p>So Uffo and his two antagonists were taken to the place of combat, an
  island in the river Eider. Crowds lined either bank, and Wermund stood
  prepared to throw himself into the river should his son be slain. Uffo
  held back at first, till he had discovered which of his antagonists was
  the more dangerous, since he feared the sword would only be good for one
  blow. Then, having by his taunts induced the champion to come to close
  quarters, he clove him asunder with one stroke. Wermund cried out that he
  had heard the sound of his son's sword, and asked where the blow had
  fallen: his attendants assured him that it had pierced, not any
  particular part, but the man's whole structure.</p>

  <p>So Wermund drew back from the edge, desiring life now as keenly as
  before he had longed for death. Finally Uffo smote his second antagonist
  through, thus opening a career which after such a beginning we may well
  believe to have been glorious.</p>

  <p>The story is told again by Sweyn Aageson in a slightly varying form.
  Sweyn's story has some good traits of its own&mdash;as when it makes Uffo
  enter the lists girt with <i>two</i> swords, intending to use his
  father's only in an emergency. The worthless sword breaks, and all the
  Danes quake for fear: whereupon Uffo draws the old sword and achieves the
  victory. But above all Sweyn Aageson tells us the <i>reason</i> of Uffo's
  dumbness and incapacity, which Saxo leaves obscure: it was the result of
  shame over the deeds of two Danes who had combined to avenge their father
  upon a single foe. What is the incident referred to we can gather from
  Saxo. Two Danes, Keto and Wigo, whose father Frowinus had been slain by a
  hostile king Athislus, attacked Athislus together, two to one, thus
  breaking the laws of the duel. Uffo had wedded the sister of <!-- Page 34
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"></a>{34}</span>Keto and Wigo,
  and it was in order to wipe out the stain left upon his family and his
  nation by their breach of duelling etiquette that he insisted upon
  fighting single-handed against two opponents.</p>

  <p>That this incident was also known in England is rendered probable by
  the fact that Freawine and Wig, who correspond to Saxo's Frowinus and
  Wiggo, are found in the genealogy of English kings, and that an Eadgils,
  king of the Myrgingas, who is almost certainly the Athislus of Saxo<a
  name="NtA74" href="#Nt74"><sup>[74]</sup></a>, also appears in Old
  English heroic poetry. It is probable then that the two tales were
  connected in Old English story: the two brethren shamefully combine to
  avenge their father: in due time the family of the slain foe take up the
  feud: Offa saves his country and his country's honour by voluntarily
  undertaking to fight one against two.</p>

  <p>About the same time that the Danish ecclesiastics were at work, a monk
  of St Albans was committing to Latin the English stories which were still
  current concerning Offa. The object of the English writer was, however,
  local rather than national. He wrote the <i>Vitae duorum Offarum</i> to
  celebrate the historic Offa, king of Mercia, the founder of his abbey,
  and that founder's ancestor, Offa I: popular tradition had confused the
  two, and much is told concerning the Mercian Offa that seems to belong
  more rightly to his forefather. The St Albans writer drew upon
  contemporary tradition, and it is evident that in certain cases, as when
  he gives two sets of names to some of the chief actors in the story, he
  is trying to harmonize two distinct versions: he makes at least one error
  which seems to point to a written source<a name="NtA75"
  href="#Nt75"><sup>[75]</sup></a>. In one of the <span
  class="scac">MSS</span> the story is illustrated by a series of very
  artistic drawings, which might possibly be from the pen of Matthew Paris
  himself<a name="NtA76" href="#Nt76"><sup>[76]</sup></a>. These drawings
  depict a version of the story which in some respects differs from the
  Latin text which they accompany.</p>

    Offa, miraculously restored, vindicates his Right. At the side, Offa is
    represented in Prayer

    <p class="cenhead"><i>From MS Cotton Nero D. I, fol. 2 b.</i></p>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>{35}</span></p>

  <p>The story is located in England. Warmundus is represented as a king of
  the Western Angles, ruling at Warwick. Offa, his only son, was blind till
  his seventh, dumb till his thirtieth year. Accordingly an ambitious
  noble, Riganus, otherwise called Aliel, claims to be recognized heir, in
  hope of gaining the throne for his son, Hildebrand (Brutus). Offa gains
  the gift of speech in answer to prayer; to the joy of his father and the
  councillors he vindicates his right, much as in the Danish story. He is
  knighted with a chosen body of companions, armed, and leads the host to
  meet the foe. He dashes across the river which separates the two armies,
  although his followers hang back. This act of cowardice on their part is
  not explained: it is apparently a reminiscence of an older version in
  which Offa fights his duel single handed by the river, and his host look
  on. The armies join battle, but after a long struggle draw away from each
  other with the victory undecided. Offa remaining in front of his men is
  attacked by Brutus (or Hildebrand) and Sueno, the sons of the usurper,
  and slays them both (a second reminiscence of the duel-scene). He then
  hurls himself again upon the foe, and wins the victory.</p>

  <p><i>Widsith</i> shows us that the Danish account has kept closer to the
  primitive story than has later English tradition. <i>Widsith</i> confirms
  the Danish view that the quarrel was with a foreign, not with a domestic
  foe, and the combat a duel, not a pitched battle: above all,
  <i>Widsith</i> confirms Saxo in representing the fight as taking place on
  the Eider&mdash;<i>b&#x12B; F&#x12B;feldore</i><a name="NtA77"
  href="#Nt77"><sup>[77]</sup></a>, whilst the account recorded by the monk
  of St Albans had localised the story in England.</p>

<p><!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"></a>{36}</span></p>

  <p>In <i>Beowulf</i> too we hear of Offa as a mighty king, "the best of
  all mankind betwixt the seas." But, although his wars are referred to, we
  are given no details of them. The episode in <i>Beowulf</i> relates
  rather to his wife Thryth, and his dealings with her. The passage is the
  most obscure in the whole poem, but this at least is clear: Thryth had an
  evil reputation for cruelty and murder: she wedded Offa, and he put a
  stop to her evil deeds: she became to him a good and loyal wife.</p>

  <p>Now in the <i>Lives of the two Offas</i> quite a long space is devoted
  to the matrimonial entanglements of both kings. Concerning Offa I, a tale
  is told of how he succoured a daughter of the king of York, who had been
  turned adrift by her father; how when his years were advancing his
  subjects pressed him to marry: and how his mind went back to the damsel
  whom he had saved, and he chose her for his wife. Whilst the king was
  absent on his wars, a messenger whom he had sent with a letter to report
  his victories passed through York, where the wicked father of Offa's
  queen lived. A false letter was substituted, commanding that the queen
  and her children should be mutilated and left to die in the woods,
  because she was a witch and had brought defeat upon the king's arms. The
  order was carried out, but a hermit rescued and healed the queen and her
  children, and ultimately united them to the king.</p>

  <p>This is a popular folk-tale which is scattered all over Europe, and
  which has many times been clothed in literary form: in France in the
  romance of the <i>Manekine</i>, in English in the metrical romance of
  <i>Emaré</i>, and in Chaucer's <i>Man of Lawes Tale</i>. From the name of
  the heroine in the last of these versions, the tale is often known as the
  <i>Constance</i>-story. But it is clear that this tale is not identical
  with the obscure story of the wife of Offa, which is indicated in
  <i>Beowulf</i>.</p>

  <p>When, however, we turn to the <i>Life of Offa II</i>, we do find a
  very close parallel to the Thryth story.</p>

    Drida (Thryth) arrives in the land of King Offa, "in nauicula
    armamentis carente"

    <p class="cenhead"><i>From MS Cotton Nero D. I, fol. 11a</i></p>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 37 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"></a>{37}</span></p>

  <p>This tells how in the days of Charles the Great a certain beautiful
  but wicked girl, related to that king, was condemned to death on account
  of her crimes, but, from respect for her birth, was exposed instead in a
  boat without sails or tackle, and driven ashore on the coast of King
  Offa's land. Drida, as she said her name was, deceived the king by a tale
  of injured innocence, and he committed her to the safe keeping of his
  mother, the Countess Marcellina. Later, Offa fell in love with Drida, and
  married her, after which she became known as <i>Quendrida</i>. But Drida
  continued her evil courses and compassed the death of St Æthelbert, the
  vassal king of East Anglia. In the end she was murdered by
  robbers&mdash;a just punishment for her crimes&mdash;and her widowed
  husband built the Abbey of St Albans as a thank-offering for her
  death.</p>

  <p>The parallel here is too striking to be denied: for Drida is but
  another way of spelling Thryth, and the character of the murderous queen
  is the same in both stories. There are, however, striking differences:
  for whereas Thryth ceases from her evil deeds and becomes a model wife to
  Offa, Drida continues on her course of crime, and is cut off by violence
  in the midst of her evil career. How are we to account for the parallels
  and for the discrepancies?</p>

  <p>As a matter of historical fact, the wife of Offa, king of Mercia,
  <i>was</i> named (not indeed Cw&oelig;nthryth, which is the form which
  should correspond to Quendrida, but) Cynethryth. The most obvious and
  facile way of accounting for the likeness between what we are told in
  <i>Beowulf</i> of the queen of Offa I, and what we are elsewhere told of
  the queen of Offa II, is to suppose that Thryth in <i>Beowulf</i> is a
  mere fiction evolved from the historic Cynethryth, wife of Offa II, and
  by poetic licence represented as the wife of his ancestor, Offa I. It was
  in this way she was explained by Professor Earle:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The name [Thrytho] was suggested by that of Cynethryth, Offa's
  queen.... The vindictive character here given to Thrytho is a poetic and
  veiled admonition addressed to Cynethryth<a name="NtA78"
  href="#Nt78"><sup>[78]</sup></a>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Unfortunately this, like many another facile theory, is open to fatal
  objections. In the first place the poem of <i>Beowulf</i> can, with fair
  certainty, be attributed to a date <i>earlier</i> than that at which the
  historic Offa and his spouse lived. Of course, it may be said that the
  Offa episode in <i>Beowulf</i> is an interpolation of a later date. But
  this needs proof.</p>

  <p>There are metrical and above all syntactical grounds <!-- Page 38
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>{38}</span>which have led
  most scholars to place <i>Beowulf</i> very early<a name="NtA79"
  href="#Nt79"><sup>[79]</sup></a>. If we wish to regard the
  <i>Offa-Thryth</i>-episode as a later interpolation, we ought first to
  prove that it is later in its syntax and metre. We have no right to
  assume that the episode is an interpolation merely because such an
  assumption may suit our theory of the development of <i>Beowulf</i>. So
  until reasons are forthcoming for supposing the episode of Thryth to be
  later than the rest of the poem, we can but note that what we know of the
  date of <i>Beowulf</i> forbids us to accept Earle's theory that Thryth is
  a reflection of, or upon, the historic Cynethryth.</p>

  <p>But there are difficulties in the way of Earle's theory even more
  serious than the chronological one. We know nothing very definitely about
  the wife of Offa II, except her name, but from a reference in a letter of
  Alcuin it seems clear that she was a woman of marked piety: it is not
  likely that she could have been guilty of deliberate murder of the kind
  represented in the <i>Life of Offa II</i>. The St Albans <i>Life</i>
  depends, so far as we know, upon the traditions which were current four
  centuries after her death. There may be, there doubtless are, some
  historic facts concerning Offa preserved in it: but we have no reason to
  think that the bad character of Offa's queen is one of them. Indeed, on
  purely intrinsic grounds we might well suppose the reverse. As a matter
  of history we know that Offa <i>did</i> put to death Æthelberht, the
  vassal king of East Anglia. When in the <i>Life</i> we find Offa
  completely exonerated, and the deed represented as an assassination
  brought about by the malice and cruelty of his queen, it seems
  intrinsically likely that we are dealing with an attempt of the monks to
  clear their founder by transferring his cruel deeds to the account of his
  wife.</p>

  <p>So far, then, from Thryth being a reflection of an historic cruel
  queen Cynethryth, it is more probable that the influence has been in the
  reverse direction; that the pious Cynethryth has been represented as a
  monster of cruelty because she has not unnaturally been confused with a
  mythical Thryth, the wife of Offa I.</p>

  <p>To this it may be objected that we have no right to assume remarkable
  coincidences, and that such a coincidence is <!-- Page 39 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>{39}</span>involved by the
  assumption that there was a story of a mythical Thryth, the wife of Offa
  I, and that this existed prior to, and independently of, the actual
  wedding of Offa II to a Cynethryth. But the exceeding frequency of the
  element <i>thryth</i> in the names of women robs this objection of all
  its point. Such a coincidence, far from being remarkable, would be the
  most natural in the world. If we look at the Mercian pedigree we find
  that almost half the ladies connected with it have that element
  <i>thryth</i> in their names. The founder of the house, Wihtlæg,
  according to Saxo Grammaticus<a name="NtA80"
  href="#Nt80"><sup>[80]</sup></a>, wedded Hermuthruda, the old English
  form of which would be Eormenthryth.</p>

  <p>It is to this lady Hermuthruda that we must now devote our attention.
  She belongs to a type which is common in folk-tale down to the time of
  Hans Andersen&mdash;the cruel princess who puts her lovers to death
  unless they can vanquish her in some way, worsting her in a contest of
  wits, such as the guessing of riddles, or a contest of strength, such as
  running, jumping, or wrestling. The stock example of this perilous maiden
  is, of course, for classical story Atalanta, for Germanic tradition the
  Brunhilt of the <i>Nibelungen Lied</i>, who demands from her wooer that
  he shall surpass her in all three feats; if he fails in one, his head is
  forfeit<a name="NtA81" href="#Nt81"><sup>[81]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Of this type was Hermuthruda: "in the cruelty of her arrogance she had
  always loathed her wooers, and inflicted upon them the supreme
  punishment, so that out of many there was not one but paid for his
  boldness with his head<a name="NtA82" href="#Nt82"><sup>[82]</sup></a>,"
  words which remind us strongly of what our poet says of Thryth.</p>

  <p>Hamlet (Amlethus) is sent by the king of Britain to woo this maiden
  for him: but she causes Hamlet's shield and the commission to be stolen
  while he sleeps: she learns from the shield that the messenger is the
  famous and valiant Hamlet, and alters the commission so that her hand is
  requested, not for the king of Britain, but for Hamlet himself. With this
  request she complies, and the wedding is celebrated. But when Wihtlæg
  (Vigletus) conquers and slays Hamlet, she weds the conqueror, thus
  becoming ancestress of Offa.</p>

<p><!-- Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>{40}</span></p>

  <p>It may well be that there is some connection between the Thryth of
  <i>Beowulf</i> and the Hermuthruda who in Saxo weds Offa's
  ancestor&mdash;that they are both types of the wild maiden who becomes a
  submissive though not always happy wife. If so, the continued wickedness
  of Drida in the <i>Life of Offa II</i> would be an alteration of the
  original story, made in order to exonerate Offa II from the deeds of
  murder which, as a matter of history, did characterize his reign.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE NON-HISTORICAL ELEMENTS</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section I. The Grendel Fight.</span></p>

  <p>When we come to the story of Beowulf's struggle with Grendel, with
  Grendel's mother, and with the dragon, we are faced by difficulties much
  greater than those which meet us when considering that background of
  Danish or Geatic history in which these stories are framed.</p>

  <p>In the first place, it is both surprising and confusing that, in the
  prologue, before the main story begins, <i>another</i> Beowulf is
  introduced, the son of Scyld Scefing. Much emphasis is laid upon the
  upbringing and youthful fame of this prince, and the glory of his father.
  Any reader would suppose that the poet is going on to tell of <i>his</i>
  adventures, when suddenly the story is switched off, and, after brief
  mention of this Beowulf's son, Healfdene, we come to Hrothgar, the
  building of Heorot, Grendel's attack, and the voyage of Beowulf the Geat
  to the rescue.</p>

  <p>Now "Beowulf" is an exceedingly rare name. The presence of the earlier
  Beowulf, Scyld's son, seems then to demand explanation, and many critics,
  working on quite different lines, have arrived independently at the
  conclusion that either the story of Grendel and his mother, or the story
  of the dragon, or both stories, were originally told of the son of Scyld,
  and only afterwards transferred to the Geatic hero. This has indeed been
  generally accepted, almost from the beginning of <!-- Page 42 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>{42}</span>Beowulf criticism<a
  name="NtA83" href="#Nt83"><sup>[83]</sup></a>. Yet, though possible
  enough, it does not admit of any demonstration.</p>

  <p>Now Beowulf, son of Scyld, clearly corresponds to a Beow or Beaw in
  the West Saxon genealogy. In this genealogy Beow is always connected with
  Scyld and Scef, and in some versions the relations are identical with
  those given in <i>Beowulf</i>: Beow, son of Scyld, son of Scef, in the
  genealogies<a name="NtA84" href="#Nt84"><sup>[84]</sup></a>,
  corresponding to Beowulf, son of Scyld Scefing, in our poem. Hence arose
  the further speculation of many scholars that the hero who slays the
  monsters was originally called, not Beowulf, but Beow, and that he was
  identical with the hero in the West Saxon pedigree; in other words, that
  the original story was of a hero Beow (son of Scyld) who slew a monster
  and a dragon: and that this adventure was only subsequently transferred
  to Beowulf, prince of the Geatas.</p>

  <p>This is a theory based upon a theory, and some confirmation may
  reasonably be asked, before it is entertained. As to the dragon-slaying,
  the confirmatory evidence is open to extreme doubt. It is dealt with in
  Section <span class="scac">VII</span> (Beowulf-Frotho), below. As to
  Grendel, one such piece of confirmation there is. The conquering Angles
  and Saxons seem to have given the names of their heroes to the lands they
  won in England: some such names&mdash;'Wade's causeway,' 'Weyland's
  smithy'&mdash;have survived to modern times. The evidence of the
  Anglo-Saxon charters shows that very many which have now been lost
  existed in England prior to the Conquest. Now in a Wiltshire charter of
  the year 931, we have <i>B&#x113;owan hammes hecgan</i> mentioned not far
  from a <i>Grendles mere</i>. This has been claimed as evidence that the
  story of Grendel, with Beow as his adversary, was localized in Wiltshire
  in the reign of Athelstan, and perhaps had been localized there since the
  settlement four centuries previously. Until recently this was accepted as
  definitely <!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page43"></a>{43}</span>proving that the Beowulf-Grendel story was
  derived from an ancient Beow-myth. Yet one such instance of
  name-association is not conclusive. We cannot leave out of consideration
  the possibility of its being a mere chance coincidence, especially
  considering how large is the number of place names recorded in Old
  English charters. Of late, people have become more sceptical in drawing
  inferences from proper names, and quite recently there has been a
  tendency entirely to overlook the evidence of the charter, by way of
  making compensation for having hitherto overrated it.</p>

  <p>All that can be said with certainty is that it <i>is</i> remarkable
  that a place named after Beowa should be found in the immediate proximity
  of a "Grendel's lake," and that this fact supports the possibility,
  though it assuredly does not prove, that in the oldest versions of the
  tale the monster queller was named Beow, not Beowulf. But it is only a
  possibility: it is not grounded upon any real evidence.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>These crucial references occur in a charter given by Athelstan at
  Luton, concerning a grant of land at Ham in Wiltshire to his thane

  class="scac">II</span>, p. 363.]</p>

  ðæt on langan hangran; ðonne on grendles mere; ðonon on dyrnan
  geat....</p>

  <p>Ambiguous as this evidence is, I do not think it can be dismissed as
  it is by Lawrence (<i>Pub. Mod. Lang. Assoc. Amer.</i> <span
  class="scac">XXIV</span>, 252) and Panzer (<i>Beowulf</i>, 397), who both
  say "How do we know that it is not the merest chance?" It <i>may</i> of
  course be chance: but this does not justify us in basing an argument upon
  the assumption that it <i>is</i> the merest chance. Lawrence continues:
  "Suppose one were to set up a theory that there was a saga-relation
  between Scyld and Bikki, and offered as proof the passage in the charter
  for the year 917 in which there are mentioned, as in the same district,
  <i>scyldes treow</i> and <i>bican sell</i>.... How much weight would this
  carry?"</p>

  <p>The answer surely is that the occurrence of the two names together in
  the charter would, by itself, give no basis whatever for starting such a
  theory: but if, on other grounds, the theory were likely, then the
  occurrence of the two names together would certainly have some
  corroborative value. Exactly how much, it is impossible to say, because
  we cannot estimate the element of chance, and we cannot <!-- Page 44
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"></a>{44}</span>be certain that
  the <i>grendel</i> and the <i>beowa</i> mentioned are identical with our
  Grendel and our Beowulf.</p>

  <p>Miller has argued [<i>Academy</i>, May 1894, p. 396] that
  <i>grendles</i> is not a proper name here, but a common noun signifying
  "drain," and that <i>grendles mere</i> therefore means "cesspool."</p>

  <p>Now "grindle" is found in modern dialect and even in Middle English<a
  name="NtA85" href="#Nt85"><sup>[85]</sup></a> in the sense of "a narrow
  ditch" or "gutter," but I doubt if it can be proved to be an Old English
  word. Evidence would rather point to its being an East Anglian corruption
  of the much more widely spread <i>drindle</i>, or <i>dringle</i>, used
  both as a verb "to go slowly, to trickle," and as "a small trickling
  stream." And even if an O.E. <i>grendel</i> as a common noun meaning
  "gutter" were authenticated, it seems unlikely to me that places were
  named "the fen," "the mere," "the pit," "the brook"&mdash;"of the
  gutter." There is no ground whatever for supposing the existence of an
  O.E. <i>grendel</i> = "sewer," or anything which would lead us to suppose
  <i>grendles mere</i> or <i>gryndeles sylle</i> to mean "cesspool<a
  name="NtA86" href="#Nt86"><sup>[86]</sup></a>." Surely it is probable,
  knowing what we do of the way in which the English settlers gave epic
  names to the localities around their settlements, that these places were
  named after Grendel because they seemed the sort of place where his story
  might be localized&mdash;like "Weyland's smithy" or "Wade's causeway":
  and that the meaning is "Grendel's fen," "mere," "pit" or "brook."</p>

  <p>Again, both Panzer and Lawrence suggest that the Beowa who gave his
  name to the <i>ham</i> may have been, not the hero, but "an ordinary
  mortal called after him" ... "some individual who lived in this
  locality." But, among the numerous English proper names recorded, can any
  instance be found of any individual named Beowa? <!-- Page 45 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page45"></a>{45}</span>And was it in accordance
  with the rules of Old English nomenclature to give to mortals the names
  of these heroes of the genealogies<a name="NtA87"
  href="#Nt87"><sup>[87]</sup></a>?</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Recent scepticism as to the "Beow-myth" has been largely due to the
  fact that speculation as to Beow had been carried too far. For example,
  because Beow appeared in the West Saxon genealogy, it had been assumed
  that the Beow-myth belonged essentially to the Angles and Saxons. Yet
  Beow would seem to have been also known among Scandinavians. For in
  somewhat later days Scandinavian genealogists, when they had made the
  acquaintance of the Anglo-Saxon pedigrees, noted that Beow had a
  Scandinavian counterpart in a hero whom they called Bjar<a name="NtA88"
  href="#Nt88"><sup>[88]</sup></a>. That something was known in the north
  of this Bjar is proved by the <i>Kálfsvísa</i>, that same catalogue of
  famous heroes and their horses which we have already found giving us the
  counterparts of Onela and Eadgils. Yet this dry reference serves to show
  that Bjar must once have been sufficiently famous to have a horse
  specially his own<a name="NtA89" href="#Nt89"><sup>[89]</sup></a>.
  Whether the fourteenth century Scandinavian who made Bjar the Northern
  equivalent of Beow was merely guessing, we unfortunately cannot tell.
  Most probably he was, for there is reason to think that the hero
  corresponding to Beow was named, not <i>Bjár</i>, but <i>Byggvir</i><a
  name="NtA90" href="#Nt90"><sup>[90]</sup></a>: a correspondence
  intelligible to modern philologists as in agreement with phonetic law,
  but naturally not obvious to an Icelandic genealogist. But however this
  may be, the assumption that Beow was peculiarly the hero of Angles and
  Saxons seems hardly justified.</p>

<p><!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46"></a>{46}</span></p>

  <p>Again, since Beow is an ancestor of Woden, it was further assumed that
  he was an ancient god, and that in the story of his adventures we had to
  deal with a nature-myth of a divine deliverer who saved the people from
  Grendel and his mother, the personified powers of the stormy sea. It is
  with the name of Müllenhoff, its most enthusiastic and ablest advocate,
  that this "mythological theory" is particularly associated. That Grendel
  is fictitious no one, of course, would deny. But Müllenhoff and his
  school, in applying the term "mythical" to those portions of the
  <i>Beowulf</i> story for which no historical explanation could be found,
  meant that they enshrined <i>nature-myths</i>. They thought that those
  elements in heroic poetry which could not be referred back to actual fact
  must be traced to ancient stories in which were recorded the nation's
  belief about the sun and the gods: about storms and seasons.</p>

  <p>The different mythological explanations of Beowulf-Beowa and Grendel
  have depended mainly upon hazardous etymological explanations of the
  hero's name. The most popular is Müllenhoff's interpretation. Beaw is the
  divine helper of man in his struggle with the elements. Grendel
  represents the stormy North Sea of early spring, flooding and destroying
  the habitations of men, till the god rescues them: Grendel's mother
  represents the depths of the ocean. But in the autumn the power of the
  god wanes: the dragon personifies the coming of the wild weather: the god
  sinks in his final struggle to safeguard the treasures of the earth for
  his people<a name="NtA91" href="#Nt91"><sup>[91]</sup></a>. Others,
  remembering that Grendel dwells in the fen, see in him rather a demon of
  the sea-marsh than of the sea itself: he is the pestilential swamp<a
  name="NtA92" href="#Nt92"><sup>[92]</sup></a>, and the hero a wind which
  drives him away<a name="NtA93" href="#Nt93"><sup>[93]</sup></a>. Or,
  whilst Grendel still represents the storms, his antagonist is a
  "Blitzheros<a name="NtA94" href="#Nt94"><sup>[94]</sup></a>." Others,
  whilst hardly ranking Beowulf as <!-- Page 47 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page47"></a>{47}</span>a god, still see an allegory in his
  adventures, and Grendel must be a personification either of an
  inundation<a name="NtA95" href="#Nt95"><sup>[95]</sup></a>, or of the
  terror of the long winter nights<a name="NtA96"
  href="#Nt96"><sup>[96]</sup></a>, or possibly of grinding at the mill,
  the work of the enslaved foe<a name="NtA97"
  href="#Nt97"><sup>[97]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Such explanations were till recently universally current: the
  instances given above might be increased considerably.</p>

  <p>Sufficient allowance was not made for the influence upon heroic poetry
  of the simple popular folk-tale, a tale of wonder with no mythological or
  allegorical meaning. Now, of late years, there has been a tendency not
  only to recognize but even to exaggerate this influence: to regard the
  hero of the folk-tale as the original and essential element in heroic
  poetry<a name="NtA98" href="#Nt98"><sup>[98]</sup></a>. Though this is
  assuredly to go too far, it is but reasonable to recognize the fairy tale
  element in the O.E. epic.</p>

  <p>We have in <i>Beowulf</i> a story of giant-killing and dragon-slaying.
  Why should we construct a legend of the gods or a nature-myth to account
  for these tales? Why must Grendel or his mother represent the tempest, or
  the malaria, or the drear long winter nights? We know that tales of
  giant-killers and dragon-slayers have been current among the people of
  Europe for thousands of years. Is it not far more easy to regard the
  story of the fight between Beowulf and Grendel merely as a fairy tale,
  glorified into an epic<a name="NtA99"
  href="#Nt99"><sup>[99]</sup></a>?</p>

  <p>Those students who of late years have tried thus to elucidate the
  story of Beowulf and Grendel, by comparison with folk-tales, have one
  great advantage over Müllenhoff and the "mythological" school. The weak
  point of Müllenhoff's view was that the nature-myth of Beow, which was
  called in to explain the origin of the Beowulf story as we have it, was
  itself only an assumption, a conjectural reconstruction. But the various
  popular tales in which scholars have more recently tried to find
  parallels to <i>Beowulf</i> have this great merit, that <!-- Page 48
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"></a>{48}</span>they do
  indubitably exist. And as to the first step&mdash;the parallel between
  <i>Beowulf</i> and the <i>Grettis saga</i>&mdash;there can, fortunately,
  be but little hesitation.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section II. The Scandinavian Parallels&mdash;Grettir and Orm.</span></p>

  <p>The <i>Grettis saga</i> tells the adventures of the most famous of all
  Icelandic outlaws, Grettir the strong. As to the historic existence of
  Grettir there is no doubt: we can even date the main events of his life,
  in spite of chronological inconsistencies, with some precision. But
  between the year 1031, when he was killed, and the latter half of the
  thirteenth century, when his saga took form, many fictitious episodes,
  derived from folk-lore, had woven themselves around his name. Of these,
  one bears a great, if possibly accidental, likeness to the Grendel story:
  the second is emphatically and unmistakably the same story as that of
  Grendel and his mother. In the first, Grettir stops at a farm house which
  is haunted by Glam, a ghost of monstrous stature. Grettir awaits his
  attack alone, but, like Beowulf, lying down. Glam's entry and onset
  resemble those of Grendel: when Grettir closes with him he tries to get
  out. They wrestle the length of the hall, and break all before them.
  Grettir supports himself against anything that will give him foothold,
  but for all his efforts he is dragged as far as the door. There he
  suddenly changes his tactics, and throws his whole weight upon his
  adversary. The monster falls, undermost, so that Grettir is able to draw,
  and strike off his head; though not till Glam has laid upon Grettir a
  curse which drags him to his doom.</p>

  <p>The second story&mdash;the adventure of Grettir at Sandhaugar
  (Sandheaps)&mdash;begins in much the same way as that of Grettir and
  Glam. Grettir is staying in a haunted farm, from which first the farmer
  himself and then a house-carl have, on two successive Yuletides, been
  spirited away. As before, a light burns in the room all night, and
  Grettir awaits the attack alone, lying down, without having put off his
  clothes. As before, Grettir and his assailant wrestle down the room,
  breaking all <!-- Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page49"></a>{49}</span>in their way. But this time Grettir is
  pulled put of the hall, and dragged to the brink of the neighbouring
  gorge. Here, by a final effort, he wrenches a hand free, draws, and hews
  off the arm of the ogress, who falls into the torrent below.</p>

  <p>Grettir conjectures that the two missing men must have been pulled by
  the ogress into the gulf. This, after his experience, is surely a
  reasonable inference: but Stein, the priest, is unconvinced. So they go
  together to the river, and find the side of the ravine a sheer precipice:
  it is ten fathom down to the water below the fall. Grettir lets down a
  rope: the priest is to watch it. Then Grettir dives in: "the priest saw
  the soles of his feet, and then knew no more what had become of him."
  Grettir swims under the fall and gets into the cave, where he sees a
  giant sitting by a fire: the giant aims a blow at him with a weapon with
  a wooden handle ("such a weapon men then called a <i>hefti-sax</i>").
  Grettir hews it asunder. The giant then grasps at another sword hanging
  on the wall of the cave, but before he can use it Grettir wounds him.
  Stein, the priest, seeing the water stained with blood from this wound,
  concludes that Grettir is dead, and departs home, lamenting the loss of
  such a man. "But Grettir let little space come between his blows till the
  giant lay dead." Grettir finds the bones of the two dead men in the cave,
  and bears them away with him to convince the priest: but when he reaches
  the rope and shakes it, there is no reply, and he has to climb up,
  unaided. He leaves the bones in the church porch, for the confusion of
  the priest, who has to admit that he has failed to do his part
  faithfully.</p>

  <p>Now if we compare this with <i>Beowulf</i>, we see that in the
  Icelandic story much is different: for example, in the <i>Grettis
  saga</i> it is the female monster who raids the habitation of men, the
  male who stays at home in his den. In this the <i>Grettis saga</i>
  probably represents a corrupt tradition: for, that the female should
  remain at home whilst the male searches for his prey, is a rule which
  holds good for devils as well as for men<a name="NtA100"
  href="#Nt100"><sup>[100]</sup></a>. <!-- Page 50 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>{50}</span>The change was presumably
  made in order to avoid the difficulty&mdash;which the <i>Beowulf</i> poet
  seems also to have realized&mdash;that after the male has been slain, the
  rout of the female is felt to be a deed of less note&mdash;something of
  an anti-climax<a name="NtA101" href="#Nt101"><sup>[101]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The sword on the wall, also, which in the <i>Beowulf</i>-story is used
  by the hero, is, in the <i>Grettir</i>-story, used by the giant in his
  attack on the hero.</p>

  <p>But that the two stories are somehow connected cannot be disputed.
  Apart from the general likeness, we have details such as the escape of
  the monster after the loss of an arm, the fire burning in the cave, the
  <i>hefti-sax</i>, a word which, like its old English equivalent
  (<i>hæft-m&#x113;ce</i>, <i>Beowulf</i>, 1457), is found in this story
  only, and the strange reasoning of the watchers that the blood-stained
  water must necessarily be due to the hero's death<a name="NtA102"
  href="#Nt102"><sup>[102]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Now obviously such a series of resemblances cannot be the result of an
  accident. Either the <i>Grettir</i>-story is derived directly or
  indirectly from the <i>Beowulf</i> epic, more or less as we have it, or
  both stories are derived from one common earlier source. The scholars who
  first discovered the resemblance believed that both stories were
  independently derived from one original<a name="NtA103"
  href="#Nt103"><sup>[103]</sup></a>. This view has generally been endorsed
  by later investigators, but not universally<a name="NtA104"
  href="#Nt104"><sup>[104]</sup></a>. And this is one of the questions
  which the student cannot leave open, because our view of the origin of
  the <i>Grendel</i>-story will have to depend largely upon the view we
  take as to its connection with the episode in the <i>Grettis
  saga</i>.</p>

  <p>If this episode be derived from <i>Beowulf</i>, then we have an
  interesting literary curiosity, but nothing further. But if it is <!--
  Page 51 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page51"></a>{51}</span>independently derived from a common source,
  then the episode in the <i>saga</i>, although so much later, may
  nevertheless contain features which have been obliterated or confused or
  forgotten in the <i>Beowulf</i> version. In that case the story, as given
  in the <i>Grettis saga</i>, would be of great weight in any attempt to
  reconstruct the presumed original form of the <i>Grendel</i>-story.</p>

  <p>The evidence seems to me to support strongly the view of the majority
  of scholars&mdash;that the <i>Grettir</i>-episode is not derived from
  <i>Beowulf</i> in the form in which that poem has come down to us, but
  that both come from one common source.</p>

  <p>It is certain that the story of the monster invading a dwelling of men
  and rendering it uninhabitable, till the adventurous deliverer arrives,
  did not originate with Hrothgar and Heorot. It is an ancient and
  widespread type of story, of which one version is localized at the Danish
  court. When therefore we find it existing, independently of its Danish
  setting, the presumption is in favour of this being a survival of the old
  independent story. Of course it is <i>conceivable</i> that the
  Hrothgar-Heorot setting might have been first added, and subsequently
  stripped off again so clean that no trace of it remains. But it seems
  going out of our way to assume this, unless we are forced to do so<a
  name="NtA105" href="#Nt105"><sup>[105]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Again, it is certain that these stories&mdash;like all the subject
  matter of the Old English epic&mdash;did not originate in England, but
  were brought across the North Sea from the old home. And that old home
  was in the closest connection, so far as the passage to and fro of story
  went, with Scandinavian lands. Nothing could be intrinsically more
  probable than that a story, current in ancient Angel and carried thence
  to England, should also have been current in Scandinavia, and thence have
  been carried to Iceland.</p>

  <p>Other stories which were current in England in the eighth century were
  also current in Scandinavia in the thirteenth. Yet this does not mean
  that the tales of Hroar and Rolf, or of Athils and Ali, were borrowed
  from English epic accounts of Hrothgar and Hrothulf, or Eadgils and
  Onela. They were part of the common inheritance&mdash;as much so as the
  strong verbs <!-- Page 52 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page52"></a>{52}</span>or the alliterative line. Why then, contrary
  to all analogy, should we assume a literary borrowing in the case of the
  <i>Beowulf-Grettir</i>-story? The compiler of the <i>Grettis saga</i>
  could not possibly have drawn his material from a <span
  class="scac">MS</span> of <i>Beowulf</i><a name="NtA106"
  href="#Nt106"><sup>[106]</sup></a>: he could not have made sense of a
  single passage. He conceivably <i>might</i> have drawn from traditions
  <i>derived</i> from the Old English epic. But it is difficult to see how.
  Long before his time these traditions had for the most part been
  forgotten in England itself. One of the longest lived of all, that of
  Offa, is heard of for the last time in England at the beginning of the
  thirteenth century. That a Scandinavian sagaman at the end of the century
  could have been in touch, in any way, with Anglo-Saxon epic tradition
  seems on the whole unlikely. The Scandinavian tradition of Offa, scholars
  are now agreed<a name="NtA107" href="#Nt107"><sup>[107]</sup></a>, was
  not borrowed from England, and there is no reason why we should assume
  such borrowing in the case of Grettir.</p>

  <p>The probability is, then, considerable, that the <i>Beowulf</i>-story
  and the <i>Grettir</i>-story are independently derived from one common
  original.</p>

  <p>And this probability would be confirmed to a certainty if we should
  find that features which have been confused and half obliterated in the
  O.E. story become clear when we turn to the Icelandic. This argument has
  lately been brought forward by Dr Lawrence in his essay on "The Haunted
  Mere in <i>Beowulf</i><a name="NtA108"
  href="#Nt108"><sup>[108]</sup></a>." Impressive as the account of this
  mere is, it does not convey any very clear picture. Grendel's home seems
  sometimes to be in the sea: and again it seems to be amid marshes, moors
  and fens, and again it is "where the mountain torrent goes down under the
  darkness of the cliffs&mdash;the water below the ground (i.e. beneath
  overhanging rocks)."</p>

  <p>This last account agrees admirably with the landscape depicted in the
  <i>Grettis saga</i>, and the gorge many fathoms deep through which the
  stream rushes, after it has fallen over the precipice; not so the other
  accounts. These descriptions are <!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page53"></a>{53}</span>best harmonized if we imagine an original
  version in which the monsters live, as in the <i>Grettis saga</i>, in a
  hole under the waterfall. This story, natural enough in a Scandinavian
  country, would be less intelligible as it travelled South. The Angles and
  Saxons, both in their old home on the Continent and their new one in
  England, were accustomed to a somewhat flat country, and would be more
  inclined to place the dwelling of outcast spirits in moor and fen than
  under waterfalls, of which they probably had only an elementary
  conception. "The giant must dwell in the fen, alone in the land<a
  name="NtA109" href="#Nt109"><sup>[109]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p>Now it is in the highest degree improbable that, after the landscape
  had been blurred as it is in <i>Beowulf</i>, it could have been brought
  out again with the distinctness it has in the <i>Grettis saga</i>. To
  preserve the features so clearly the <i>Grettir</i>-story can hardly be
  derived from <i>Beowulf</i>: it must have come down independently.</p>

  <p>But if so, it becomes at once of prime importance. For by a comparison
  of <i>Beowulf</i> and <i>Grettir</i> we must form an idea of what the
  original story was, from which both were derived.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Another parallel, though a less striking one, has been found in the
  story of Orm Storolfsson, which is extant in a short saga about
  contemporary with that of Grettir, <i>Ormsþáttr Stórólfssonar</i><a
  name="NtA110" href="#Nt110"><sup>[110]</sup></a>, in two ballads from the
  Faroe Islands<a name="NtA111" href="#Nt111"><sup>[111]</sup></a> and two
  from Sweden<a name="NtA112" href="#Nt112"><sup>[112]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>It is generally asserted that the <i>Orm</i>-story affords a close
  parallel to the episodes of Grendel and his mother. I cannot find close
  resemblance, and I strongly suspect that the repetition of the assertion
  is due to the fact that the <i>Orm</i>-story has not been very easily
  accessible, and has often been taken as read by the critics.</p>

  <p>But, in any case, it has been proved that the <i>Orm</i>-tale borrows
  largely from other sagas, and notably from the <i>Grettis saga</i>
  itself<a name="NtA113" href="#Nt113"><sup>[113]</sup></a>. Before
  arguing, therefore, from any parallel, it must first be shown that the
  feature in which Orm resembles <!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page54"></a>{54}</span>Beowulf is not derived at second hand from
  the <i>Grettis saga</i>. One such feature there is, namely Orm's piety,
  which he certainly does not derive from Grettir. In this he with equal
  certainty resembles Beowulf. According to modern ideas, indeed, there is
  more of the Christian hero in Beowulf than in Orm.</p>

  <p>Now Orm owes his victory to the fact, among other things, that, at the
  critical moment, he vows to God and the holy apostle St Peter to make a
  pilgrimage to Rome should he be successful. In this a parallel is seen to
  the fact that Beowulf is saved, not only by his coat of mail, but also by
  the divine interposition<a name="NtA114"
  href="#Nt114"><sup>[114]</sup></a>. But is this really a parallel?
  Beowulf is too much of a sportsman to buy victory by making a vow when in
  a tight place. <i>G&#x1E3;ð &#x101; wyrd sw&#x101; h&#x12B;o scel</i><a
  name="NtA115" href="#Nt115"><sup>[115]</sup></a> is the exact antithesis
  of Orm's pledge.</p>

  <p>However, I have given in the Second Part the text of the
  <i>Orm</i>-episode, so that readers may judge for themselves the
  closeness or remoteness of the parallel.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The parallel between Grettir and Beowulf was noted by the Icelander
  Gudbrand Vigfússon upon his first reading <i>Beowulf</i> (see
  <i>Prolegomena to Sturlunga saga</i>, 1878, p. xlix: <i>Corpus Poeticum
  Boreale</i>, <span class="scac">II</span>, 501: <i>Icelandic Reader</i>,

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section III. Bothvar Bjarki.</span></p>

  <p>We have seen that there are in <i>Beowulf</i> two distinct elements,
  which never seem quite harmonized: firstly the historic background of the
  Danish and Geatic courts, with their chieftains, Hrothgar and Hrothulf,
  or Hrethel and Hygelac: and secondly the old wives' fables of struggles
  with ogres and dragons. In the story of Grettir, the ogre fable
  appears&mdash;unmistakably connected with the similar story as given in
  <i>Beowulf</i>, but with <!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page55"></a>{55}</span>no faintest trace of having ever possessed
  any Danish heroic setting.</p>

  <p>Turning back to the <i>Saga of Rolf Kraki</i>, we <i>do</i> find
  against that Danish setting a figure, that of the hero Bothvar Bjarki,
  bearing a very remarkable resemblance to Beowulf.</p>

  <p>Bjarki, bent on adventure, leaves the land of the Gautar (Götar),
  where his brother is king, and reaches Leire, where Rolf, the king of the
  Danes, holds his court; [just as Beowulf, bent on adventure, leaves the
  land of the Geatas (Götar) where his uncle is king, and reaches Heorot,
  where Hrothgar and Hrothulf (Rolf) hold court].</p>

  <p>Arrived at Leire, Bjarki takes under his protection the despised
  coward Hott, whom Rolf's retainers have been wont to bully. The champions
  at the Danish court [in <i>Beowulf</i> one of them only&mdash;Unferth]
  prove quarrelsome, and they assail the hero during the feast, in the
  <i>Saga</i> by throwing bones at him, in <i>Beowulf</i> only by bitter
  words. The hero in each case replies, in kind, with such effect that the
  enemy is silenced.</p>

  <p>But despite the fame and splendour of the Danish court, it has long
  been subject to the attacks of a strange monster<a name="NtA116"
  href="#Nt116"><sup>[116]</sup></a>&mdash;a winged beast whom no iron will
  bite [just as Grendel is immune from swords<a name="NtA117"
  href="#Nt117"><sup>[117]</sup></a>]. Bjarki [like Beowulf<a name="NtA118"
  href="#Nt118"><sup>[118]</sup></a>] is scornful at the inability of the
  Danes to defend their own home: "if one beast can lay waste the kingdom
  and the cattle of the king." He goes out to fight with the monster <i>by
  night</i>, accompanied only by Hott. He tries to draw his sword, but the
  sword is fast in its sheath: he tugs, the sword comes out, and he slays
  the beast with it. This seems a most pointless incident: taken in
  connection with the supposed invulnerability of the foe, it looks like
  the survival of some episode in which the hero was unwilling [as in
  Beowulf's fight with Grendel<a name="NtA119"
  href="#Nt119"><sup>[119]</sup></a>] or unable [as in Beowulf's fight with
  Grendel's mother<a name="NtA120" href="#Nt120"><sup>[120]</sup></a>] to
  slay the foe <!-- Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page56"></a>{56}</span>with his sword. Bjarki then compels the
  terrified coward Hott to drink the monster's blood. Hott forthwith
  becomes a valiant champion, second only to Bjarki himself. The beast is
  then propped up as if still alive: when it is seen next morning the king
  calls upon his retainers to play the man, and Bjarki tells Hott that now
  is the time to clear his reputation. Hott demands first the sword,
  Gullinhjalti, from Rolf, and with this he slays the dead beast a second
  time. King Rolf is not deceived by this trick; yet he rejoices that
  Bjarki has not only himself slain the monster, but changed the cowardly
  Hott into a champion; he commands that Hott shall be called Hjalti, after
  the sword which has been given him. We are hardly justified in demanding
  logic in a wild tale like this, or one might ask how Rolf was convinced
  of Hott's valour by what he knew to be a piece of stage management on the
  part of Bjarki. But, however that may be, it is remarkable that in
  <i>Beowulf</i> also the monster Grendel, though proof against all
  ordinary weapons, is smitten <i>when dead</i> by a magic sword of which
  the <i>golden hilt</i><a name="NtA121" href="#Nt121"><sup>[121]</sup></a>
  is specially mentioned.</p>

  <p>In addition to the undeniable similarity of the stories of these
  heroes, a certain similarity of name has been claimed. That <i>Bjarki</i>
  is not etymologically connected with <i>B&#x113;owulf</i> or
  <i>B&#x113;ow</i> is clear: but if we are to accept the identification of
  Beowulf and Beow, remembering that the Scandinavian equivalent of the
  latter is said to be <i>Bjár</i>, the resemblance to <i>Bjarki</i> is
  obvious. Similarity of sound might have caused one name to be substituted
  for another<a name="NtA122" href="#Nt122"><sup>[122]</sup></a>. This
  argument obviously depends upon the identification <i>B&#x113;ow</i> =
  <i>Bjár</i>, which is extremely doubtful: it will be argued below that it
  is more likely that <i>B&#x113;ow</i> = <i>Byggvir</i><a name="NtA123"
  href="#Nt123"><sup>[123]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>But force remains in the argument that the name Bjarki (little bear)
  is very appropriate to a hero like the Beowulf of <!-- Page 57 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page57"></a>{57}</span>our epic, who crushes or
  hugs his foe to death instead of using his sword; even if we do not
  accept explanations which would interpret the name "Beowulf" itself as a
  synonym for "Bear."</p>

  <p>It is scarcely to be wondered at, then, that most critics have seen in
  Bjarki a Scandinavian parallel to Beowulf. But serious difficulties
  remain. There is in the Scandinavian story a mass of detail quite
  unparallelled in <i>Beowulf</i>, which overshadows the resemblances.
  Bjarki's friendship, for example, with the coward Hott or Hjalti has no
  counterpart in <i>Beowulf</i>. And Bjarki becomes a retainer of King Rolf
  and dies in his service, whilst Beowulf never comes into direct contact
  with Hrothulf at all; the poet seems to avoid naming them together.
  Still, it is quite intelligible that the story should have developed on
  different lines in Scandinavia from those which it followed in England,
  till the new growths overshadowed the original resemblance, without
  obliterating it. After nearly a thousand years of independent development
  discrepancies must be expected. It would not be a reasonable objection to
  the identity of <i>Gullinhjalti</i> with <i>Gyldenhilt</i>, that the word
  <i>hilt</i> had grown to have a rather different meaning in Norse and in
  English; subsequent developments do not invalidate an original
  resemblance if the points of contact are really there.</p>

  <p>But, allowing for this independent growth in Scandinavia, we should
  naturally expect that the further back we traced the story the greater
  the resemblance would become.</p>

  <p>This brings us to the second, serious difficulty: that, when we turn
  from the <i>Saga of Rolf Kraki</i>&mdash;belonging in its present form
  perhaps to the early fifteenth century&mdash;to the pages of Saxo
  Grammaticus, who tells the same tale more than two centuries earlier, the
  resemblance, instead of becoming stronger, almost vanishes. Nothing is
  said of Bjarki coming from Gautland, or indeed of his being a stranger at
  the Danish court: nothing is said of the monster having paid previous
  visits, visits repeated till king Rolf, like Hrothgar, has to give up all
  attempt at resistance, and submit to its depredations. The monster,
  instead of being a troll, like Grendel, becomes a commonplace bear. All
  Saxo tells us is that "He [Biarco, i.e. Bjarki] met a great bear in a
  thicket and slew it with a spear, and bade his <!-- Page 58 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page58"></a>{58}</span>comrade Ialto [i.e.
  Hjalti] place his lips to the beast and drink its blood as it flowed,
  that he might become stronger."</p>

  <p>Hence the Danish scholar, Axel Olrik, in the best and most elaborate
  discussion of Bjarki and all about him, has roundly denied any connection
  between his hero and Beowulf. He is astonished at the slenderness of the
  evidence upon which previous students have argued for relationship.
  "Neither Beowulf's wrestling match in the hall, nor in the fen, nor his
  struggle with the firedrake has any real identity, but when we take a
  little of them all we can get a kind of similarity with the latest and
  worst form of the Bjarki saga<a name="NtA124"
  href="#Nt124"><sup>[124]</sup></a>." The development of Saxo's bear into
  a winged monster, "the worst of trolls," Olrik regards as simply in
  accordance with the usual heightening, in later Icelandic, of these early
  stories of struggles with beasts, and of this he gives a parallel
  instance.</p>

  <p>Some Icelandic ballads on Bjarki (the <i>Bjarka rímur</i>), which were
  first printed in 1904, were claimed by Olrik as supporting his
  contention. These ballads belong to about the year 1400. Yet, though they
  are thus in date and dialect closely allied to the <i>Saga of Rolf
  Kraki</i> and remote from Saxo Grammaticus, they are so far from
  supporting the tradition of the <i>Saga</i> with regard to the monster
  slain, that they represent the foe first as a man-eating she-wolf, which
  is slain by Bjarki, then as a grey bear [as in Saxo], which is slain by
  Hjalti after he has been compelled to drink the blood of the she-wolf. We
  must therefore give up the winged beast as mere later elaboration; for if
  the Bjarki ballads in a point like this support Saxo, as against the
  <i>Saga</i> which is so closely connected with them by its date and
  Icelandic tongue, we must admit Saxo's version here to represent, beyond
  dispute, the genuine tradition.</p>

  <p>Accordingly the attempt which has been made to connect Bjarki's winged
  monster with Beowulf's winged dragon goes overboard at once. But such an
  attempt ought never to have been made at all. The parallel is between
  Bjarki and the Beowulf-Grendel episode, not between Bjarki and the
  Beowulf-dragon episode, which ought to be left out of consideration. And
  the monstrous bear and the wolf of the <i>Rímur</i> are not so <!-- Page
  59 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"></a>{59}</span>dissimilar
  from Grendel, with his bear-like hug, and Grendel's mother, the
  'sea-wolf<a name="NtA125" href="#Nt125"><sup>[125]</sup></a>.'</p>

  <p>The likeness between Beowulf and Bjarki lies, not in the wingedness or
  otherwise of the monsters they overthrow, but in the similarity of the
  position&mdash;in the situation which places the most famous court of the
  North, and its illustrious king, at the mercy of a ravaging foe, till a
  chance stranger from Gautland brings deliverance. And here the
  <i>Rímur</i> support, not Saxo, but the <i>Saga</i>, though in an outworn
  and faded way. In the <i>Rímur</i> Bjarki is a stranger come from abroad:
  the bear has made previous attacks upon the king's folds.</p>

  <p>Thus, whilst we grant the wings of the beast to be a later
  elaboration, it does not in the least follow that other features in which
  the <i>Saga</i> differs from Saxo&mdash;the advent of Bjarki from
  Gautland, for instance&mdash;are also later elaboration.</p>

  <p>And we must be careful not to attach too much weight to the account of
  Saxo merely because it is earlier in date than that of the <i>Saga</i>.
  The presumption is, of course, that the earlier form will be the more
  original: but just as a late manuscript will often preserve, amidst its
  corruptions, features which are lost in much earlier manuscripts, so will
  a tradition. Saxo's accounts are often imperfect<a name="NtA126"
  href="#Nt126"><sup>[126]</sup></a>. And in this particular instance,
  there is a want of coherency and intelligibility in Saxo's account, which
  in itself affords a strong presumption that it <i>is</i> imperfect.</p>

  <p>What Saxo tells us is this:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>At which banquet, when the champions were rioting with every kind of
  wantonness, and flinging knuckle-bones at a certain Ialto [Hjalti] from
  all sides, it happened that his messmate Biarco [Bjarki] through the bad
  aim of the thrower received a severe blow on the head. But Biarco,
  equally annoyed by the injury and the insult, sent the bone back to the
  thrower, so that he twisted the front of his head to the back and the
  back to the front, punishing the cross-grain of the man's temper by
  turning his face round about.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But who were this "certain Hjalti" and Bjarki? There seems to be
  something missing in the story. The explanation [which Saxo does not give
  us, but the <i>Saga</i> does] that Bjarki has come from afar and taken
  the despised Hott-Hjalti under his <!-- Page 60 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>{60}</span>protection, seems to be
  necessary. Why was Hjalti chosen as the victim, at whom missiles were to
  be discharged? Obviously [though Saxo does not tell us so], because he
  was the butt of the mess. And if Bjarki had been one of the mess for many
  hours, his messmates would have known him too well to throw knuckle-bones
  either at him or his friend. This is largely a matter of personal
  feeling, but Saxo's account seems to me pointless, till it is
  supplemented from the <i>Saga</i><a name="NtA127"
  href="#Nt127"><sup>[127]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>And there is one further piece of evidence which seems to clinch the
  whole matter finally, though its importance has been curiously
  overlooked, by Panzer and Lawrence in their arguments for the
  identification, and by Olrik in his arguments to the contrary.</p>

  <p>We have seen above how Beowulf "became a friend" to Eadgils, helping
  him in his expedition against King Onela of Sweden, and avenging, in
  "chill raids fraught with woe," <i>cealdum cears&#x12B;ðum</i>, the
  wrongs which Onela had inflicted upon the Geatas. We saw, too, that this
  expedition was remembered in Scandinavian tradition. "They had a battle
  on the ice of Lake Wener; there King Ali fell, and Athils had the
  victory. Concerning this battle there is much said in the <i>Skjoldunga
  saga</i>." The <i>Skjoldunga saga</i> is lost, but the Latin extracts
  from it give some information about this battle<a name="NtA128"
  href="#Nt128"><sup>[128]</sup></a>. Further, an account of it <i>is</i>
  preserved in the <i>Bjarka rímur</i>, probably derived from the lost
  <i>Skjoldunga saga</i>. And the <i>Bjarka rímur</i> expressly mention
  Bjarki as helping Athils in this battle against Ali on the ice of Lake
  Wener<a name="NtA129" href="#Nt129"><sup>[129]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Olrik does not seem to allow for this at all, though of course aware
  of it. The other parallels between Bjarki and Beowulf he believes to be
  mere coincidence. But is this likely?</p>

  <p>To recapitulate: In old English tradition a hero comes from the land
  of the Geatas to the royal court of Denmark, where Hrothgar and Hrothulf
  hold sway. This hero is received in none too friendly wise by one of the
  retainers, but <!-- Page 61 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page61"></a>{61}</span>puts his foe to shame, is warmly welcomed by
  the king, and slays by night a monster which has been attacking the
  Danish capital and against which the warriors of that court have been
  helpless. The monster is proof against all swords, yet its dead body is
  mutilated by a sword with a golden hilt. Subsequently this same hero
  helps King Eadgils of Sweden to overthrow Onela.</p>

  <p>We find precisely the same situation in Icelandic tradition some seven
  centuries later, except that not Hrothgar and Hrothulf, but Hrothulf
  (Rolf) alone is represented as ruling the Danes, and the sword with the
  golden hilt has become a sword named "Golden-hilt." It is
  <i>conceivable</i> for a situation to have been reconstructed in this way
  by mere accident, just as it is conceivable that one player may have the
  eight or nine best trumps dealt him. But it does not seem advisable to
  base one's calculations, as Olrik does, upon such an accident
  happening.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The parallel of Bjarki and Beowulf seems to have been first noted by
  Gisli Brynjulfsson (<i>Antiquarisk Tidsskrift</i>, 1852-3, p. 130). It
  has been often discussed by Sarrazin (<i>Beowulf Studien</i>, 13
  <i>etc.</i>, 47: <i>Anglia</i>, <span class="scac">IX</span>, 195
  <i>etc.</i>: <i>Engl. Stud.</i> <span class="sc">xvi</span>, 79
  <i>etc.</i>, <span class="scac">XXIII</span>, 242 <i>etc.</i>, <span
  class="scac">XXXV</span>, 19 <i>etc.</i>). Sarrazin's over-elaborated
  parallels form a broad target for doubters: it must be remembered that a
  case, though it may be discredited, is not invalidated by exaggeration.
  The problem is of course noted in the Beowulf studies of Müllenhoff (55),
  Bugge (<i>P.B.B.</i> <span class="scac">XII</span>, 55) and Boer (<i>Die
  Beowulfsage</i>, <span class="scac">II</span>, in <i>Arkiv f. nord.

  at length and convincingly by Panzer (364-386) and Lawrence (<i>Pub. Mod.
  Lang. Assoc. Amer.</i> <span class="scac">XXIV</span>, 1909, 222
  <i>etc.</i>). The usual view which accepts some relationship is endorsed
  by all these scholars, as it is by Finnur Jónsson in his edition of the
  <i>Hrólfs Saga Kraka og Bjarkarímur</i> (København, 1904, p. xxii).</p>

  <p>Ten Brink (185 <i>etc.</i>) denied any original connection, on the
  ground of the dissimilarity between <i>Beowulf</i> and the story given by
  Saxo. Any resemblances between <i>Beowulf</i> and the <i>Hrólfs Saga</i>
  he attributed to the influence of the English <i>Beowulf</i>-story upon
  the <i>Saga</i>.</p>

  <p>For Olrik's emphatic denial of any connection at all, see <i>Danmarks
  Heltedigtning</i>, <span class="scac">I</span>, 134 <i>etc.</i> (This
  seems to have influenced Brandl, who expresses some doubt in <i>Pauls

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section IV. Parallels from Folklore.</span></p>

  <p>Hitherto we have been dealing with parallels to the Grendel story in
  written literature: but a further series of parallels, although much more
  remote, is to be found in that vast store of old wives' tales which no
  one till the nineteenth century took the trouble to write down
  systematically, but which certainly go back to a very ancient period. One
  particular tale, that of the Bear's Son<a name="NtA130"
  href="#Nt130"><sup>[130]</sup></a> (extant in many forms), has been
  instanced as showing a resemblance to the <i>Beowulf</i>-story. In this
  tale the hero, a young man of extraordinary strength, (1) sets out on his
  adventures, associating with himself various companions; (2) makes
  resistance in a house against a supernatural being, which his fellows
  have in vain striven to withstand, and succeeds in mishandling or
  mutilating him. (3) By the blood-stained track of this creature, or
  guided by him in some other manner, the hero finds his way to a spring,
  or hole in the earth, (4) is lowered down by a cord and (5) overcomes in
  the underworld different supernatural foes, amongst whom is often
  included his former foe, or very rarely the mother of that foe: victory
  can often only be gained by the use of a magic sword which the hero finds
  below. (6) The hero is left treacherously in the lurch by his companions,
  whose duty it was to have drawn him up...</p>

  <p>Now it may be objected, with truth, that this is not like the
  <i>Beowulf</i>-story, or even particularly like the <i>Grettir</i>-story.
  But the question is not merely whether it resembles these stories as we
  possess them, but whether it resembles the story which must have been the
  common origin of both. And we have only to try to reconstruct from
  <i>Beowulf</i> and from the <i>Grettis saga</i> a tale which can have
  been the common original of both, to see that it must be something
  extraordinarily like the folk-tale outlined above.</p>

<p><!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63"></a>{63}</span></p>

  <p>For example, it is true that the departure of the Danes homeward
  because they believe that Beowulf has met his death in the water below,
  bears only the remotest resemblance to the deliberate treachery which the
  companions in the folk-tale mete out to the hero. But when we compare the
  <i>Grettir</i>-story, we see there that a real breach of trust is
  involved, for there the priest Stein leaves the hero in the lurch, and
  abandons the rope by which he should have drawn Grettir up. This can
  hardly be an innovation on the part of the composer of the <i>Grettis
  saga</i>, for he is quite well disposed towards Stein, and has no motive
  for wantonly attributing treachery to him. The innovation presumably lies
  in the <i>Beowulf</i>-story, where Hrothgar and his court are depicted in
  such a friendly spirit that no disreputable act can be attributed to
  them, and consequently Hrothgar's departure home must not be allowed in
  any way to imperil or inconvenience the hero. A comparison of the
  <i>Beowulf</i>-story with the <i>Grettir</i>-story leads then to the
  conclusion that in the oldest version those who remained above when the
  hero plunged below <i>were</i> guilty of some measure of disloyalty in
  ceasing to watch for him. In other words we see that the further we track
  the <i>Beowulf</i>-story back, the more it comes to resemble the
  folk-tale.</p>

  <p>And our belief that there is some connection between the folk-tale and
  the original of <i>Beowulf</i> must be strengthened when we find that, by
  a comparison of the folk-tale, we are able to explain features in
  <i>Beowulf</i> which strike us as difficult and even absurd: precisely as
  when we turn to a study of Shakespeare's sources we often find the
  explanation of things that puzzle us: we see that the poet is dealing
  with an unmanageable source, which he cannot make quite plausible. For
  instance: when Grendel enters Heorot he kills and eats the first of
  Beowulf's retinue whom he finds: no one tries to prevent him. The only
  explanation which the poet has to offer is that the retinue are all
  asleep<a name="NtA131" href="#Nt131"><sup>[131]</sup></a>&mdash;strange
  somnolence on the part of men who are awaiting a hostile attack, which
  they expect will be fatal to them all<a name="NtA132"
  href="#Nt132"><sup>[132]</sup></a>. And Beowulf at any rate is not
  asleep. Yet he calmly watches whilst his henchman is <!-- Page 64
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"></a>{64}</span>both killed and
  eaten: and apparently, but for the accident that the monster next tackles
  Beowulf himself, he would have allowed his whole bodyguard to be devoured
  one after another.</p>

  <p>But if we suppose the story to be derived from the folk-tale, we have
  an explanation. For in the folk-tale, the companions and the hero await
  the foe singly, in succession: the turn of the hero comes last, after all
  his companions have been put to shame. But Beowulf, who is represented as
  having specially voyaged to Heorot in order to purge it, cannot leave the
  defence of the hall for the first night to one of his comrades. Hence the
  discomfiture of the comrade and the single-handed success of the hero
  have to be represented as simultaneous. The result is incongruous:
  Beowulf <i>has</i> to look on whilst his comrade is killed.</p>

  <p>Again, both Beowulf and Grettir plunge in the water with a sword, and
  with the deliberate object of shedding the monster's blood. Why then
  should the watchers on the cliff above assume that the blood-stained
  water must necessarily signify the <i>hero's</i> death, and depart home?
  Why did it never occur to them that this deluge of blood might much more
  suitably proceed from the monster?</p>

  <p>But we can understand this unreason if we suppose that the
  story-teller had to start from the deliberate and treacherous departure
  of the companions, whilst at the same time it was not to his purpose to
  represent the companions as treacherous. In that case some excuse
  <i>must</i> be found for them: and the blood-stained water was the
  nearest at hand<a name="NtA133" href="#Nt133"><sup>[133]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Again, quite independently of the folk-tale, many <i>Beowulf</i>
  scholars have come to the conclusion that in the original version of the
  story the hero did not wait for a second attack from the mother of the
  monster he had slain, but rather, from a natural and laudable desire to
  complete his task, followed the monster's tracks to the mere, and
  finished him and his mother below. Many traits have survived which may
  conceivably point to an original version of the story in which Beowulf
  (or the figure corresponding to him) at once plunged down <!-- Page 65
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"></a>{65}</span>in order to
  combat the foe corresponding to Grendel. There are unsatisfactory
  features in the story as it stands. For why, it might be urged, should
  the wrenching off of an arm have been fatal to so tough a monster? And
  why, it has often been asked, is the adversary under the water sometimes
  male, sometimes female? And why is it apparently the blood of Grendel,
  not of his mother, which discolours the water and burns up the sword, and
  the head of Grendel, not of his mother, which is brought home in triumph?
  These arguments may not carry much weight, but at any rate when we turn
  to the folk-tale we find that the adventure beneath the earth <i>is</i>
  the natural following up of the adventure in the house, not the result of
  any renewed attack.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In addition, there are many striking coincidences between individual
  versions or groups of the folk-tale on the one hand and the
  <i>Beowulf-Grettir</i> story on the other: yet it is very difficult to
  know what value should be attached to these parallels, since there are
  many features of popular story which float around and attach themselves
  to this or that tale without any original connection, so that it is easy
  for the same trait to recur in <i>Beowulf</i> and in a group of
  folk-tales, without this proving that the stories as a whole are
  connected<a name="NtA134" href="#Nt134"><sup>[134]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The hero of the Bear's son folk-tale is often in his youth
  unmanageable or lazy. This is also emphasized in the stories both of
  Grettir and of Orm: and though such a feature was uncongenial to the
  courtly tone of <i>Beowulf</i>, which sought to depict the hero as a
  model prince, yet it <i>is</i> there<a name="NtA135"
  href="#Nt135"><sup>[135]</sup></a>, even though only alluded to
  incidentally, and elsewhere ignored or even denied<a name="NtA136"
  href="#Nt136"><sup>[136]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Again, the hero of the folk-tale is very frequently (but not
  necessarily) either descended from a bear, nourished by a bear, or has
  some ursine characteristic. We see this recurring in certain traits of
  Beowulf such as his bear-like method of hugging <!-- Page 66 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>{66}</span>his adversary to death.
  Here again the courtly poet has not emphasized his hero's wildness<a
  name="NtA137" href="#Nt137"><sup>[137]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Again, there are some extraordinary coincidences in names, between the
  <i>Beowulf-Grettir</i> story and the folk-tale. These are not found in
  <i>Beowulf</i> itself, but only in the stories of Grettir and Orm. Yet,
  as the <i>Grettir</i>-episode is presumably derived from the same
  original as the <i>Beowulf</i>-episode, any <i>original</i> connection
  between it and the folk-tale involves such connection for <i>Beowulf</i>
  also. We have seen that in <i>Grettis saga</i> the priest Stein, as the
  unfaithful guardian of the rope which is to draw up the hero, seems to
  represent the faithless companions of the folktale. There is really no
  other way of accounting for him, for except on this supposition he is
  quite otiose and unnecessary to the <i>Grettir</i>-story: the saga-man
  has no use for him. And his name confirms this explanation, for in the
  folk-tale one of the three faithless companions of the hero is called the
  Stone-cleaver, <i>Steinhauer</i>, <i>Stenkløver</i>, or even, in one
  Scandinavian version, simply <i>Stein</i><a name="NtA138"
  href="#Nt138"><sup>[138]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Again, the struggle in the <i>Grettis saga</i> is localized at
  Sandhaugar in Barthardal in Northern Iceland. Yet it is difficult to say
  why the saga-teller located the story there. The scenery, with the
  neighbouring river and mighty waterfall, is fully described: but students
  of Icelandic topography assert that the neighbourhood does <i>not</i> at
  all lend itself to this description<a name="NtA139"
  href="#Nt139"><sup>[139]</sup></a>. When we turn to the story of Orm we
  find it localized on the island Sandey. We are forced to the conclusion
  that the name belongs to the story, and that in some early version this
  was localized at a place called Sandhaug, perhaps at one of the numerous
  places in Norway of that name. Now turning to one of the Scandinavian
  versions of the folk-tale, we find that the descent into the earth and
  the consequent struggle is localized in <i>en stor sandhaug</i><a
  name="NtA140" href="#Nt140"><sup>[140]</sup></a>.</p>

<p><!-- Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>{67}</span></p>

  <p>On the other hand, it must be remembered that if a collection is made
  of some two hundred folk-tales, it is bound to contain, in addition to
  the essential kernel of common tradition, a vast amount of that floating
  material which tends to associate itself with this or that hero of story.
  Individual versions or groups of versions of the tale may contain
  features which occur also in the <i>Grendel</i>-story, without that being
  any evidence for primitive connection. Thus we are told how Grendel
  forces open the door of Heorot. In a Sicilian version of the folk-tale
  the doors spring open of themselves as the foe appears. This has been
  claimed as a parallel. But, as a sceptic has observed, the extraordinary
  thing is that of so slight a similarity (if it is entitled to be called a
  similarity) we should find only one example out of two hundred, and have
  to go to Sicily for that<a name="NtA141"
  href="#Nt141"><sup>[141]</sup></a>.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The parallel between the <i>Beowulf</i>-story and the "Bear's son"
  folk-tale had been noted by Laistner (<i>Das Rätsel der Sphinx</i>,
  Berlin, 1889, <span class="scac">II</span>, 22 <i>etc.</i>): but the
  prevalent belief that the <i>Beowulf</i>-story was a nature-myth seems to
  have prevented further investigation on these lines till Panzer
  independently (p. 254) undertook his monumental work.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Yet there are other features in the folk-tale which are entirely
  unrepresented in the <i>Beowulf-Grettir</i> story. The hero of the
  folk-tale rescues captive princesses in the underworld (it is because
  they wish to rob him of this prize that his companions leave him below);
  he is saved by some miraculous helper, and finally, after adopting a
  disguise, puts his treacherous comrades to shame and weds the youngest
  princess. None of these elements<a name="NtA142"
  href="#Nt142"><sup>[142]</sup></a> are to be found in the stories of
  Beowulf, Grettir, Orm or Bjarki, yet they are essential to the fairy
  tale<a name="NtA143" href="#Nt143"><sup>[143]</sup></a>.</p>

<p><!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"></a>{68}</span></p>

  <p>So that to speak of <i>Beowulf</i> as a version of the fairy tale is
  undoubtedly going too far. All we can say is that some early story-teller
  took, from folk-tale, those elements which suited his purpose, and that a
  tale, containing many leading features found in the "Bear's son" story,
  but omitting many of the leading motives of that story, came to be told
  of Beowulf and of Grettir<a name="NtA144"
  href="#Nt144"><sup>[144]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section V. Scef and Scyld.</span></p>

  <p>Our poem begins with an account of the might, and of the funeral, of
  Scyld Scefing, the ancestor of that Danish royal house which is to play
  so large a part in the story. After Scyld's death his retainers,
  following the command he had given them, placed their beloved prince in
  the bosom of a ship, surrounded by many treasures brought from distant
  lands, by weapons of battle and weeds of war, swords and byrnies. Also
  they placed a golden banner high over his head, and let the sea bear him
  away, with soul sorrowful and downcast. Men could not say for a truth,
  not the wisest of councillors, who received that burden.</p>

  <p>Now there is much in this that can be paralleled both from the
  literature and from the archaeological remains of the North. Abundant
  traces have been found, either of the burial or of the burning of a chief
  within a ship. And we are told by different authorities of two ancient
  Swedish kings who, sorely wounded, and unwilling to die in their beds,
  had themselves placed upon ships, surrounded by weapons and the bodies of
  the slain. The funeral pyre was then lighted on the vessel, and the ship
  sent blazing out to sea. Similarly the dead body of Baldr was put upon
  his ship, and burnt.</p>

  <p>The <i>Skjoldunga Saga</i> gives a story which is obviously connected
  with this. King Sigurd Ring in his old age asked in marriage the lady
  Alfsola; but her brothers scorned to give her to an aged man. War
  followed; and the brothers, knowing that they could not withstand the
  hosts of Sigurd, poisoned their sister before marching against him. In

  <p>So with the death of Baldr.</p>

  <p>En æsirnir tóku lík Baldrs ok fluttu til sævar. Hringhorni hét skip
  Baldrs; hann var allra skipa mestr, hann vildu goðin framm setja ok gera
  þar á bálf&#x1EB;r Baldrs ... þá var borit út á skipit lík Baldrs,...
  Oðinn lagði á bálit gullhring þann, er Draupnir heitir ... hestr Baldrs
  var leiddr á bálit með &#x1EB;llu reiði.</p>

  <p>(But the gods took the body of Baldr and carried it to the sea-shore.
  Baldr's ship was named Hringhorni: it was the greatest of all ships and
  the gods sought to launch it, and to build the pyre of Baldr on it....
  Then was the body of Baldr borne out on to the ship.... Odin laid on the
  pyre the gold ring named Draupnir ... and Baldr's horse with all his
  trappings was placed on the pyre.)</p>

  <p><i>Snorra Edda: Gylfaginning</i>, 48; udg. af Finnur Jónsson,
  København, 1900.</p>

  <p>We are justified in rendering <i>setja skip fram</i> by "launch":
  Olrik (<i>Heltedigtning</i>, <span class="scac">I</span>, 250) regards
  Baldr's funeral as a case of the burning of a body in a ship on land. But
  it seems to me, as to Mr Chadwick (<i>Origin</i>, 287), that the natural
  meaning is that the ship was launched in the sea.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But the case of Scyld is not exactly parallel to these. The ship which
  conveyed Scyld out to sea was <i>not</i> set alight. And the words of the
  poet, though dark, seem to imply that it was intended to come to land
  somewhere: "None could say who received that freight." <!-- Page 70
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"></a>{70}</span></p>

  <p>Further, Scyld not merely departed over the waves&mdash;he had in the
  first instance come over them: "Not with less treasure did they adorn
  him," says the poet, speaking of the funeral rites, "than did those who
  at the beginning sent him forth alone over the waves, being yet a
  child."</p>

  <p>Scyld Scefing then, like Tennyson's Arthur, comes from the unknown and
  departs back to it.</p>

  <p>The story of the mysterious coming over the water was not confined to
  Scyld. It meets us in connection with King Scef, who was regarded, at any
  rate from the time of Alfred, and possibly much earlier, as the remotest
  ancestor of the Wessex kings. Ethelwerd, a member of the West Saxon royal
  house, who compiled a bombastic Latin chronicle towards the end of the
  tenth century, traces back the pedigree of the kings of Wessex to Scyld
  <i>and his father Scef</i>. "This Scef," he says, "came to land on a
  swift boat, surrounded by arms, in an island of the ocean called Scani,
  when a very young child. He was unknown to the people of that land, but
  was adopted by them as if of their kin, well cared for, and afterwards
  elected king<a name="NtA145" href="#Nt145"><sup>[145]</sup></a>." Note
  here, firstly, that the story is told, not of Scyld Scefing, but of Scef,
  father of Scyld. Secondly, that although Ethelwerd is speaking of the
  ancestor of the West Saxon royal house, he makes him come to land and
  rule, not in the ancient homeland of continental Angeln, but in the
  "island of Scani," which signifies what is now the south of Sweden, and
  perhaps also the Danish islands<a name="NtA146"
  href="#Nt146"><sup>[146]</sup></a>&mdash;that same land of
  <i>Scedenig</i> which is mentioned in <i>Beowulf</i> as the realm of
  Scyld. The tone of the narrative is, so far as we can judge from
  Ethelwerd's dry summary, entirely warlike: Scef is surrounded by
  weapons.</p>

  <p>In the twelfth century the story is again told by William of
  Malmesbury. "Sceldius was the son of Sceaf. He, they say, was carried as
  a small boy in a boat without any oarsman to a certain isle of Germany
  called Scandza, concerning which <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page71"></a>{71}</span>Jordanes, the historian of the Goths,
  speaks. He was sleeping, and a handful of corn was placed at his head,
  from which he was called 'Sheaf.' He was regarded as a wonder by the folk
  of that country and carefully nurtured; when grown up he ruled in a town
  then called Slaswic, and now Haithebi&mdash;that region is called ancient
  Anglia<a name="NtA147" href="#Nt147"><sup>[147]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p>William of Malmesbury was, of course, aware of Ethelwerd's account,
  and may have been influenced by it. Some of his variations may be his own
  invention. The substitution of the classical form <i>Scandza</i> for
  Ethelwerd's <i>Scani</i> is simply a change from popular to learned
  nomenclature, and enables the historian to show that he has read
  something of Jordanes. The alteration by which Malmesbury makes Sceaf,
  when grown up, rule at Schleswig in ancient Angel, may again be his own
  work&mdash;a variant added in order to make Sceaf look more at home in an
  Anglo-Saxon pedigree.</p>

  <p>But William of Malmesbury was, as we shall see later, prone to
  incorporate current ballads into his history, and after allowing for what
  he may have derived from Ethelwerd, and what he may have invented, there
  can be no doubt that many of the additional details which he gives are
  genuine popular poetry. Indeed, whilst the story of Scyld's
  <i>funeral</i> is very impressive in <i>Beowulf</i>, it is in William's
  narrative that the story of the child coming over the sea first becomes
  poetic.</p>

  <p>Now since even the English historians connected this tale with the
  Danish territory of <i>Scani, Scandza</i>, we should expect to find it
  again on turning to the records of the Danish royal house. And we do find
  there, generally at the head of the pedigree<a name="NtA148"
  href="#Nt148"><sup>[148]</sup></a>, a hero&mdash;Skjold&mdash;whose name
  corresponds, and whose relationship to the later Danish kings shows him
  to be the same as the <i>Scyld Scefing</i> of <i>Beowulf</i>. But neither
  Saxo Grammaticus, nor any other Danish historian, knows anything of <!--
  Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"></a>{72}</span>Skjold
  having come in his youth or returned in his death over the ocean.</p>

  <p>How are we to harmonize these accounts?</p>

  <p><i>Beowulf</i> and Ethelwerd agree in representing the hero as
  "surrounded by arms"; William of Malmesbury mentions only the sheaf; the
  difference is weighty, for presumably the spoils which the hero brings
  with him from the unknown, or takes back thither, are in harmony with his
  career. <i>Beowulf</i> and Ethelwerd seem to show the warrior king,
  William of Malmesbury seems rather to be telling the story of a
  semi-divine foundling, who introduces the tillage of the earth<a
  name="NtA149" href="#Nt149"><sup>[149]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>In <i>Beowulf</i> the child is Scyld Scefing, in Ethelwerd and William
  of Malmesbury he is Sceaf, father of Scyld.</p>

  <p><i>Beowulf</i>, Ethelwerd and William of Malmesbury agree in
  connecting the story with <i>Scedenig</i>, <i>Scani</i> or
  <i>Scandza</i>, yet the two historians and the <i>Anglo-Saxon
  Chronicle</i> all make Sceaf the ancestor of the West Saxon house. Yet we
  have no evidence that the English were regarded as having come from
  Scandinavia.</p>

  <p>The last problem admits of easy solution. In heathen times the English
  traced the pedigree of most of their kings to Woden, and stopped there.
  For higher than that they could not go. But a Christian poet or
  genealogist, who had no belief in Woden as a god, would regard the All
  Father as a man&mdash;a mere man who, by magic powers, had made the
  heathen believe he was a god. To such a Christian pedigree-maker Woden
  would convey no idea of finality; he would feel no difficulty in giving
  this human Woden any number of ancestors. Wishing to glorify the pedigree
  of his king, he would add any other distinguished and authentic
  genealogies, and the obvious place for these would be at the end of the
  line, i.e., above Woden. Hence we have in some quite early (not West
  Saxon) pedigrees, five names given as ancestors of Woden. These five
  names end in Geat or Geata, who was apparently regarded as a god, and was
  possibly Woden under another name<a name="NtA150"
  href="#Nt150"><sup>[150]</sup></a>. Somewhat later, in the <i>Anglo-Saxon
  Chronicle</i>, under <!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page73"></a>{73}</span>the year 855, we have a long version of the
  West Saxon pedigree with yet nine further names above Geat, ending in
  Sceaf. Sceaf is described as a son of Noah, and so the pedigree is
  carried back to Adam, 25 generations in all beyond Woden<a name="NtA151"
  href="#Nt151"><sup>[151]</sup></a>. But it is rash to assume with
  Müllenhoff that, because Sceaf comes at the head<a name="NtA152"
  href="#Nt152"><sup>[152]</sup></a> of this English pedigree, Sceaf was
  therefore essentially an English hero. <i>All</i> these later stages
  above Woden look like the ornate additions of a later compiler. Some of
  the figures, Finn, Sceldwa, Heremod, Sceaf himself, we have reason to
  identify with the primitive heroes of other nations.</p>

  <p>The genealogist who finally made Sceaf into a son born to Noah in the
  ark, and then carried the pedigree nine stages further back through Noah
  to Adam, merely made the last of a series of accretions. It does not
  follow that, because he made them ancestors of the English king, this
  compiler regarded Noah, Enoch and Adam as Englishmen. Neither need he
  have so regarded Sceaf or Scyld<a name="NtA153"
  href="#Nt153"><sup>[153]</sup></a> or Beaw. In fact&mdash;and this has
  constantly been overlooked&mdash;the authority for Sceaf, Scyld and Beaw
  as Anglo-Saxon heroes is but little stronger than the authority for Noah
  and Adam in that capacity. No manuscript exists which stops at Scyld or
  Sceaf. There is no version which goes beyond Geat except that which goes
  up to Adam. Scyld, Beaw, Sceaf, Noah and Adam as heroes of English
  mythology are all alike doubtful.</p>

  <p>We must be careful, however, to define what we mean when we regard
  these stages of the pedigree as doubtful. They are doubtful in so far as
  they are represented as standing above Woden in the Anglo-Saxon pedigree,
  because it is incredible that, in primitive and heathen times, Woden was
  credited with a dozen or more forefathers. The <i>position</i> of these
  names in the pedigree is therefore doubtful. But it is only their
  connection with the West Saxon house that is unauthentic. It does not
  follow that the names are, <i>per se</i>, unauthentic. On the contrary,
  it is because the genealogist had such implicit belief in the
  authenticity of the generations <!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page74"></a>{74}</span>from Noah to Adam that he could not rest
  satisfied with his West Saxon pedigree till he had incorporated these
  names. They are not West Saxon, but they are part of a tradition much
  more ancient than any pedigree of the West Saxon kings. And the argument
  which applies to the layer of Hebrew names between Noah and Adam applies
  equally to the layer of Germanic names between Woden and Sceaf. From
  whatever branch of the Germanic race the genealogist may have taken them,
  the fact that he placed them where he did in the pedigree is a proof of
  his veneration for them. But we must not without evidence claim them as
  West Saxon or Anglo-Saxon: we must not be surprised if evidence points to
  some of them being connected with other nations&mdash;as Heremod, for
  example, with the Danes<a name="NtA154"
  href="#Nt154"><sup>[154]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>More difficult are the other problems. William of Malmesbury tells the
  story of Sceaf, with the attributes of a culture-hero: <i>Beowulf</i>,
  four centuries earlier, tells it of Scyld, a warrior hero: Ethelwerd
  tells it of Sceaf, but gives him the warrior attributes of Scyld<a
  name="NtA155" href="#Nt155"><sup>[155]</sup></a> instead of the sheaf of
  corn.</p>

  <p>The earlier scholars mostly agreed<a name="NtA156"
  href="#Nt156"><sup>[156]</sup></a> in regarding Malmesbury's attribution
  of the story to Sceaf as the original and correct version of the story,
  in spite of its late date. As a representative of these early scholars we
  may take Müllenhoff<a name="NtA157" href="#Nt157"><sup>[157]</sup></a>.
  Müllenhoff's love of mythological interpretation found ample scope in the
  story of the child with the sheaf, which he, with considerable reason,
  regarded as a "culture-myth." Müllenhoff believed the carrying over of
  the attributes of a god to a line of his supposed descendants to be a
  common feature of myth&mdash;the descendants representing the god under
  another name. In accordance with this view, Scyld could be explained as
  an "hypostasis" of his father or forefather Sceaf, as a figure further
  explaining him and representing him, so that in the end the tale of the
  boat arrival came to be told, in <i>Beowulf</i>, of Scyld instead of
  Sceaf.</p>

<p><!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"></a>{75}</span></p>

  <p>Recent years have seen a revolt against most of Müllenhoff's theories.
  The view that the story originally belonged to Sceaf has come to be
  regarded with a certain amount of impatience as "out of date." Even so
  fine a scholar as Dr Lawrence has expressed this impatience:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That the graceful story of the boy sailing in an open boat to the
  land of his future people was told originally of Sceaf ... needs no
  detailed refutation at the present day.</p>

  <p>"The attachment of the motive to Sceaf must be, as an examination of
  the sources shows, a later development<a name="NtA158"
  href="#Nt158"><sup>[158]</sup></a>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Accordingly the view of recent scholars has been this: That the story
  belongs essentially to Scyld. That, as the hero of the boat story is
  obviously of unknown parentage, we must interpret <i>Scefing</i> not as
  "son of Sceaf" but as "with the sheaf" (in itself a quite possible
  explanation). That this stage of the story is preserved in
  <i>Beowulf</i>. That subsequently <i>Scyld Scefing</i>, standing at the
  head of the pedigree, came to be misunderstood as "Scyld, son of Sceaf".
  That consequently the story, which must be told of the earlier ancestor,
  was thus transferred from Scyld to his supposed father Sceaf&mdash;the
  version which is found in Ethelwerd and William of Malmesbury.</p>

  <p>One apparent advantage of this theory is that the oldest version, that
  of <i>Beowulf</i>, is accepted as the correct and original one, and the
  much later versions of the historians Ethelwerd and William of Malmesbury
  are regarded as subsequent corruptions. This on the surface seems
  eminently reasonable. But let us look closer. <i>Scyld Scefing</i> in
  <i>Beowulf</i> is to be interpreted "Scyld with the Sheaf." But
  <i>Beowulf</i> nowhere mentions the sheaf as part of Scyld's equipment.
  On the contrary, we gather that the hero is connected rather with prowess
  in war. It is the same in Ethelwerd. It is not till William of Malmesbury
  that the sheaf comes into the story. So that the interpretation of
  <i>Scefing</i> as "with the sheaf" assumes the accuracy of William of
  Malmesbury's story even in a point where it receives no support from the
  <i>Beowulf</i> version. In other words this theory does the very thing to
  avoid doing which it was called into being<a name="NtA159"
  href="#Nt159"><sup>[159]</sup></a>.</p>

<p><!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"></a>{76}</span></p>

  <p>Besides this, there are two fundamental objections to the theory that
  Sceaf is a late creation, a figure formed from the misunderstanding of
  the epithet <i>Scefing</i> applied to <i>Scyld</i>. One portion of the
  poem of <i>Widsith</i> consists of a catalogue of ancient kings, and
  among these occurs <i>Sceafa</i>, ruling the Langobards. Now portions of
  <i>Widsith</i> are very ancient, and this catalogue in which Sceafa
  occurs is almost certainly appreciably older than <i>Beowulf</i>
  itself.</p>

  <p>Secondly, the story of the wonderful foundling who comes over the sea
  from the unknown and founds a royal line, must <i>ex hypothesi</i> be
  told of the first in the line, and we have seen that it is Sceaf, not
  Scyld, who comes at the head of the Teutonic names in the genealogy in
  the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>.</p>

  <p>Now we can date this genealogy fairly exactly. It occurs under the
  year 855, and seems to have been drawn up at the court of King Æthelwulf.
  In any case it cannot be later than the latter part of Alfred's reign.
  This takes us back to a period when the old English epic was still widely
  popular. A genealogist at Alfred's court must have known much about Old
  English story.</p>

  <p>These facts are simply not consistent with the belief that Sceaf is a
  late creation, a figure formed from a misunderstanding of the epithet
  <i>Scefing</i>, applied to Scyld<a name="NtA160"
  href="#Nt160"><sup>[160]</sup></a>.</p>

<p><!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"></a>{77}</span></p>

  <p>To arrive at any definite conclusion is difficult. But the following
  may be hazarded.</p>

  <p>It may be taken as proved that the Scyld or Sceldwa of the
  genealogists is identical with the Scyld Scefing of <i>Beowulf</i>. For
  Sceldwa according to the genealogy is also ultimately a <i>Sceafing</i>,
  and is the father of Beow; Scyld is <i>Scefing</i> and is father of
  Beowulf<a name="NtA161" href="#Nt161"><sup>[161]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>It is equally clear that the Scyld Scefing of <i>Beowulf</i> is
  identical with the Skjold of the Danish genealogists and historians. For
  Scyld and Skjold are both represented as the founder and head of the
  Danish royal house of Scyldingas or Skjoldungar, and as reigning in the
  same district. Here, however, the resemblance ceases. <i>Beowulf</i>
  tells us of Scyld's marvellous coming and departure. The only Danish
  authority who tells us much of Skjold is Saxo Grammaticus, who records
  how as a boy Skjold wrestled successfully with a bear and overcame
  champions, and how later he annulled unrighteous laws, and distinguished
  himself by generosity to his court. But the Danish and English accounts
  have nothing specifically in common, though the type they portray is the
  same&mdash;that of a king from his youth beloved by his retainers and
  feared by neighbouring peoples, whom he subdues and makes tributary. It
  looks rather as if the oldest traditions had had little to say about this
  hero beyond the typical things which might be said of any great king; so
  that Danes and English had each supplied the deficiency in their own
  way.</p>

  <p>Now this is exactly what we should expect. For Scyld-Skjold is hardly
  a personality: he is a figure evolved out of the name <i>Scyldingas</i>,
  <i>Skjoldungar</i>, which is an old epic title for the Danes. Of this we
  may be fairly certain: the Scyldingas did not get their name because they
  were really descended from Scyld, but Scyld was created in order to
  provide an eponymous father to the Scyldingas<a name="NtA162"
  href="#Nt162"><sup>[162]</sup></a>. In just the same way <!-- Page 78
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"></a>{78}</span>tradition also
  evolved a hero Dan, from whom the Danes were supposed to have their name.
  Saxo Grammaticus has combined both pedigrees, making Skjold a descendant
  of Dan; but usually it was agreed that nothing came before Skjold, that
  he was the beginning of the Skjoldung line<a name="NtA163"
  href="#Nt163"><sup>[163]</sup></a>. At first a mere name, we should
  expect that he would have no characteristic save that, like every
  respectable Germanic king, he took tribute from his foes and gave it to
  his friends. He differs therefore from those heroic figures like Hygelac
  or Guthhere (Gunnar) which, being derived from actual historic
  characters, have, from the beginning of their story, certain definite
  features attached to them. Scyld is, in the beginning, merely a name, the
  ancestor of the Scyldings. Tradition collects round him gradually.</p>

  <p>Hence it will be rash to attach much weight to any feature which is
  found in one account of him only. Anything we are told of Scyld in
  English sources alone is not to be construed as evidence as to his
  original story, but only as to the form that story assumed in England.
  When, for example, <i>Beowulf</i> tells us that Scyld is <i>Scefing</i>,
  or that he is father of Beowulf, it will be very rash of us to assume
  that these relationships existed in the Danish, but have been forgotten.
  This is, I think, universally admitted<a name="NtA164"
  href="#Nt164"><sup>[164]</sup></a>. Yet the very scholars who emphasize
  this, have assumed that the marvellous arrival as a child, in a boat,
  surrounded by weapons, is an essential feature of Scyld's story. Yet the
  evidence for this is no better and no worse than the evidence for his
  relationship to Sceaf or Beow&mdash;it rests solely on the English
  documents. Accordingly it only shows what was told about Scyld in
  England.</p>

  <p>Of course the boat arrival <i>might</i> be an original part of the
  story of <i>Scyld-Skjold</i>, which has been forgotten in his native <!--
  Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page79"></a>{79}</span>country,
  but remembered in England. But I cannot see that we have any right to
  assert this, without proof.</p>

  <p>What we can assert to have been the original feature of Scyld is
  this&mdash;that he was the eponymous hero king of the Danes. Both
  <i>Beowulf</i> and the Scandinavian authorities agree upon that. The fact
  that his name (in the form <i>Sceldwa</i>) appears in the genealogy of
  the kings of Wessex is not evidence against a Danish origin. The name
  appears in close connection with that of Heremod, another Danish king,
  and is merely evidence of a desire on the part of the genealogist of the
  Wessex kings to connect his royal house with the most distinguished
  family he knew: that of the Scyldingas, about whom so much is said in the
  prologue to <i>Beowulf</i>.</p>

  <p>Neither do the instances of place-names in England, such as <i>Scyldes
  treow</i>, <i>Scildes well</i>, prove Scyld to have been an English hero.
  They merely prove him to have been a hero who was celebrated in
  England&mdash;which the Prologue to <i>Beowulf</i> alone is sufficient to
  show to have been the case. For place-names commemorating heroes of alien
  tribes are common enough<a name="NtA165"
  href="#Nt165"><sup>[165]</sup></a> on English ground.</p>

  <p>So much at least is gained. Whatever Müllenhoff<a name="NtA166"
  href="#Nt166"><sup>[166]</sup></a> and his followers constructed upon the
  assumption that Scyld was an essentially Anglo-Saxon hero goes overboard.
  Scyld is the ancestor king of the Danish house&mdash;more than this we
  can hardly with safety assert.</p>

  <p>Now let us turn to the figure of Sceaf. This was not necessarily
  connected with Scyld from the first.</p>

  <p>The story of Sceaf first meets us in its completeness in the pages of
  William of Malmesbury. And William of Malmesbury is a twelfth century
  authority; by his time the Old English courtly epics had died
  out&mdash;for they could not have long survived the Norman Conquest and
  the overthrow of Old English court life. But the popular tradition<a
  name="NtA167" href="#Nt167"><sup>[167]</sup></a> remained, and <!-- Page
  80 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"></a>{80}</span>a good many
  of the old stories, banished from the hall, must have lingered on at the
  cross-roads&mdash;tales of Wade and Weyland, of Offa and Sceaf. For
  songs, sung by minstrels at the cross roads, William of Malmesbury is
  good evidence, and he owns to having drawn information from similar
  popular sources<a name="NtA168" href="#Nt168"><sup>[168]</sup></a>.
  William's story, then, is evidence that in his own day there was a
  tradition of a mythical king Sheaf who came as a child sleeping in a ship
  with a sheaf of corn at his head How old this tradition may be, we cannot
  say. Ethelwerd knew the story, though he has nothing to say of the sheaf.
  But we have seen that when we get back to the ninth century, and the
  formation of the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>, at a court where we may be
  sure the old English heroic stories were still popular, it is Sceaf and
  not Sceldwa who is regarded as the beginning of things&mdash;the king
  whose origin is so remote that he is the oldest Germanic ancestor one can
  get back to<a name="NtA169" href="#Nt169"><sup>[169]</sup></a>: "he was
  born in Noah's ark."</p>

  <p>Whether or no Noah's ark was chosen as Sceaf's birthplace because
  legend represented him as coming in a boat over the water, we cannot
  tell. But the place he occupies, with only the Biblical names before him,
  as compared with Sceldwa the son of Heremod, clearly marks Sceaf rather
  than Sceldwa as the hero who comes from the unknown. Turning now to the
  catalogue of kings in <i>Widsith</i>, probably the oldest extant piece of
  Anglo-Saxon verse, some generations more ancient than <i>Beowulf</i>, we
  find a King Sceafa, who ruled over the Langobards. Finally, in
  <i>Beowulf</i> itself, although the story is told of Scyld, nevertheless
  this Scyld is characterized as <i>Scefing</i>. If this means "with the
  sheaf," then the <i>Beowulf</i>-story stands convicted of imperfection,
  of needing explanation outside itself from the <!-- Page 81 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page81"></a>{81}</span>account which William of
  Malmesbury wrote four centuries later. If it means "son of Sceaf," why
  should a father be given to Scyld, when the story demands that he should
  come from the unknown? Was it because, if the boat story was to be
  attributed to Scyld, it was felt that this could only be made plausible
  by giving him some relation to Sceaf?</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>When we find an ancient king bearing the extraordinary name of
  "Sheaf," it is difficult not to connect this with the honour done to the
  sheaf of corn, survivals of which have been found in different parts of
  England. In Herrick's time, the sheaves of corn were still kissed as they
  were carried home on the Hock-cart, whilst</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i20">Some, with great</p>
      <p>Devotion, stroke the home-borne wheat.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Professor Chadwick argues, on the analogy of Prussian and Bulgarian
  harvest customs, that the figure of the "Harvest Queen" in the English
  ceremony is derived from a corn figure made from the last sheaf, and that
  the sheaf was once regarded as a religious symbol<a name="NtA170"
  href="#Nt170"><sup>[170]</sup></a>. But the evidence for this is surely
  even stronger than would be gathered from Professor Chadwick's very
  cautious statement. I suppose there is hardly a county in England from
  Kent to Cornwall and from Kent to Northumberland, where there is not
  evidence for honour paid to the last sheaf&mdash;an honour which cannot
  be accounted for as merely expressing the joy of the reapers at having
  got to the end of their task. In Kent "a figure composed of some of the
  best corn" was made into a human shape: "this is afterwards curiously
  dressed by the women, and adorned with paper trimmings cut to resemble a
  cap, ruffles, handkerchief, etc., of the finest lace. It is brought home
  with the last load of corn<a name="NtA171"
  href="#Nt171"><sup>[171]</sup></a>." In Northumberland and Durham a sheaf
  known as the "Kern baby" was made into the likeness of a human figure,
  decked out and brought home in triumph with dancing and singing<a
  name="NtA172" href="#Nt172"><sup>[172]</sup></a>. But the most striking
  form of the sheaf ceremony is found in the honour done to the "Neck" in
  the West of England.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>... After the wheat is all cut, on most farms in the north of Devon
  the harvest people have a custom of "crying the neck." I believe that
  this practice is seldom omitted on any large farm in that part of the
  country. It is done in this way. An old man, or someone else well
  acquainted with the ceremonies used on the occasion (when the labourers
  are reaping the last field of wheat), goes round to the shocks and
  sheaves, and picks out a little bundle of all the best ears he can find;
  this bundle he ties up very neat and trim, and plats and arranges the
  straws very tastefully. This is called "the neck" of wheat, or
  wheaten-ears. After the field is cut out, and the pitcher once more
  circulated, the reapers, binders, and the women, stand round in a circle.
  The person with "the neck" stands in the centre, grasping it with both
  his hands. He first stoops and holds it near the ground, and all the men
  forming the ring take off their hats, stooping and holding them with both
  hands towards the ground. They then all begin at once in a very prolonged
  and harmonious tone to cry "the neck!" at the same time slowly raising
  themselves upright, and elevating their arms and hats above their heads;
  the person with "the neck" also raising it on high. This is done three
  times. They then change their cry to "wee yen!"&mdash;"way
  yen!"&mdash;which they sound in the same prolonged and slow manner as
  before, with singular harmony and effect, three times. This last cry is
  accompanied by the same movements of the body and arms as in crying "the
  neck." ...</p>

  <p>... After having thus repeated "the neck" three times, and "wee yen"
  or "way yen" as often, they all burst out into a kind of loud and joyous
  laugh, flinging up their hats and caps into the air, capering about and
  perhaps kissing the girls. One of them then gets "the neck," and runs as
  hard as he can down to the farm-house, where the dairy-maid, or one of
  the young female domestics, stands at the door prepared with a pail of
  water. If he who holds "the neck" can manage to get into the house, in
  any way, unseen or openly, by any other way than the door at which the
  girl stands with the pail of water, then he may lawfully kiss her; but,
  if otherwise, he is regularly soused with the contents of the bucket. On
  a fine still autumn evening, the "crying of the neck" has a wonderful
  effect at a distance, far finer than that of the Turkish muezzin, which
  Lord Byron eulogizes so much, and which he says is preferable to all the
  bells in Christendom. I have once or twice heard upwards of twenty men
  cry it, and sometimes joined by an equal number of female voices. About
  three years back, on some high grounds, where our people were harvesting,
  I heard six or seven "necks" cried in one night, although I know that
  some of them were four miles off<a name="NtA173"

  <p>The account given by Mrs Bray of the Devonshire custom, in her letters
  to Southey, is practically identical with this<a name="NtA174"
  href="#Nt174"><sup>[174]</sup></a>. We have plenty of evidence for this
  ceremony of "Crying the Neck" in the South-Western counties in
  Somersetshire<a name="NtA175" href="#Nt175"><sup>[175]</sup></a>, in
  Cornwall<a name="NtA176" href="#Nt176"><sup>[176]</sup></a>, and in a

  href="#Nt177"><sup>[177]</sup></a>.</p>

<p><!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>{83}</span></p>

  <p>On the Welsh border the essence of the ceremony consisted in tying the
  last ears of corn&mdash;perhaps twenty&mdash;with ribbon, and severing
  this "neck" by throwing the sickle at it from some distance. The custom
  is recorded in Cheshire<a name="NtA178"
  href="#Nt178"><sup>[178]</sup></a>, Shropshire<a name="NtA179"
  href="#Nt179"><sup>[179]</sup></a>, and under a different name in
  Herefordshire<a name="NtA180" href="#Nt180"><sup>[180]</sup></a>. The
  term "neck" seems to have been known as far afield as Yorkshire and the
  "little England beyond Wales"&mdash;the English-speaking colony of
  Pembrokeshire<a name="NtA181" href="#Nt181"><sup>[181]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Whether we are to interpret the expression "the Neck," applied to the
  last sheaf, as descended from a time when "the corn spirit is conceived
  in human form, and the last standing corn is a part of its body&mdash;its
  neck<a name="NtA182" href="#Nt182"><sup>[182]</sup></a> ..." or whether
  it is merely a survival of the Scandinavian word for
  sheaf&mdash;<i>nek</i> or <i>neg</i><a name="NtA183"
  href="#Nt183"><sup>[183]</sup></a>, we have here surely evidence of the
  worship of the sheaf. "In this way 'Sheaf' was greeted, before he passed
  over into a purely mythical being<a name="NtA184"
  href="#Nt184"><sup>[184]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p>I do not think these "neck" customs can be traced back beyond the
  seventeenth century<a name="NtA185" href="#Nt185"><sup>[185]</sup></a>.
  Though analogous usages are recorded in England (near Eton) as early as
  the sixteenth century<a name="NtA186" href="#Nt186"><sup>[186]</sup></a>,
  it was not usual at that time to trouble to record such things.</p>

  <p>The earliest document bearing upon the veneration of the sheaf comes
  from a neighbouring district, and is contained in the Chronicle of the
  Monastery of Abingdon, which tells how in the time of King Edmund
  (941-946) a controversy arose as to the right of the monks of Abingdon to
  a certain portion of land adjoining the river. The monks appealed to a
  judgment of God to vindicate their claim, and this took the shape of <!--
  Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"></a>{84}</span>placing
  a sheaf, with a taper on the top, upon a round shield and letting it
  float down the river, the shield by its movements hither and thither
  indicating accurately the boundaries of the monastic domain. At last the
  shield came to the field in debate, which, thanks to the floods, it was
  able to circumnavigate<a name="NtA187"
  href="#Nt187"><sup>[187]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Professor Chadwick, who first emphasized the importance of this
  strange ordeal<a name="NtA188" href="#Nt188"><sup>[188]</sup></a>, points
  out that although the extant <span class="scac">MSS</span> of the
  <i>Chronicle</i> date from the thirteenth century, the mention of a
  <i>round</i> shield carries the superstition back to a period before the
  Norman Conquest. Therefore this story seems to give us evidence for the
  use of the sheaf and shield together as a magic symbol in Anglo-Saxon
  times. "An ordeal by letting the sheaf sail down the river on a shield
  was only possible at a time when the sheaf was regarded as a kind of
  supernatural being which could find the way itself<a name="NtA189"
  href="#Nt189"><sup>[189]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p>But a still closer parallel to the story of the corn-figure coming
  over the water is found in Finnish mythology in the person of Sämpsä
  Pellervoinen. Finnish mythology seems remote from our subject, but if the
  figure of Sämpsä was borrowed from Germanic mythology, as seems to be
  thought<a name="NtA190" href="#Nt190"><sup>[190]</sup></a>, we are
  justified in laying great weight upon the parallel.</p>

  <p>Readers of the <i>Kalewala</i> will remember, near the beginning, the
  figure of Sämpsä Pellervoinen, the god of Vegetation. He does not seem to
  do much. But there are other Finnish <!-- Page 85 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page85"></a>{85}</span>poems in his honour,
  extant in varying versions<a name="NtA191"
  href="#Nt191"><sup>[191]</sup></a>. It is difficult to get a collected
  idea from these fragmentary records, but it seems to be this: Ahti, the
  god of the sea, sends messengers to summon Sämpsä, so that he may bring
  fertility to the fields. In one version, first the Winter and then the
  Summer are sent to arouse Sämpsä, that he may make the crops and trees
  grow. Winter&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Took a foal swift as the spring wind,</p>
      <p>Let the storm wind bear him forward,</p>
      <p>Blew the trees till they were leafless,</p>
      <p>Blew the grass till it was seedless,</p>
      <p>Bloodless likewise the young maidens.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Sämpsä refuses to come. Then the Summer is sent with better results.
  In another version Sämpsä is fetched from an island beyond the sea:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>It is I who summoned Sämpsä</p>
      <p>From an isle amid the ocean,</p>
      <p>From a skerry bare and treeless.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In yet another variant we are told how the boy Sämpsä</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Took six grains from off the corn heap,</p>
      <p>Slept all summer mid the corn heap,</p>
      <p>In the bosom of the corn boat.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Now "It's a long, long way to" Ilomantsi in the east of Finland, where
  this last variant was discovered. But at least we have evidence that,
  within the region influenced by Germanic mythology, the spirit of
  vegetation was thought of as a boy coming over the sea, or sleeping in a
  boat with corn<a name="NtA192" href="#Nt192"><sup>[192]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>To sum up:</p>

  <p>Sceafa, when the Catalogue of Kings in <i>Widsith</i> was drawn
  up&mdash;before <i>Beowulf</i> was composed, at any rate in its present
  form&mdash;was regarded as an ancient king. When the West Saxon pedigree
  was drawn up, certainly not much more than a century and a half after the
  composition of <i>Beowulf</i>, and perhaps much less, Sceaf was regarded
  as the primitive figure in the pedigree, before whom no one lived save
  the Hebrew patriarchs. That he was originally thought of as a child, <!--
  Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"></a>{86}</span>coming
  across the water, with the sheaf of corn, is, in view of the Finnish
  parallel, exceedingly probable, and acquires some confirmation from the
  Chronicler's placing him in Noah's ark. But the definite evidence for
  this is late.</p>

  <p>Scyld, on the other hand, is in the first place probably a mere eponym
  of the power of the Scylding kings of Denmark. He may, at a very early
  date, have been provided with a ship funeral, since later two Swedish
  kings, both apparently of Danish origin, have this ship funeral accorded
  to them, and in one case it is expressly said to be "according to the
  custom of his ancestors." But it seems exceedingly improbable that his
  original story represented him as coming over the sea in a boat. For, if
  so, it remains to be explained why this motive has entirely disappeared
  among his own people in Scandinavia, and has been preserved only in
  England. Would the Danes have been likely to forget utterly so striking a
  story, concerning the king from whom their line derived its name?
  Further, in England, <i>Beowulf</i> alone attributes this story to Scyld,
  whilst later historians attribute it to Sceaf. In view of the way in
  which the story of William of Malmesbury is supported by folklore, to
  regard that story as merely the result of error or invention seems
  perilous indeed.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, all becomes straightforward if we allow that Scyld
  and Sceaf were both ancient figures standing at the head of famous
  dynasties. Their names alliterate. What more likely than that their
  stories should have influenced each other, and that one king should have
  come to be regarded as the parent or ancestor of the other? Contamination
  with Scyld would account for Sceaf's boat being stated to have come to
  land in Scani, Scanza&mdash;that Scedeland which is mentioned as the seat
  of Scyld's rule. Yet this explanation is not necessary, for if Sceaf were
  an early Longobard king, he would be rightly represented as ruling in
  Scandinavia<a name="NtA193" href="#Nt193"><sup>[193]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section VI. Beow.</span></p>

  <p>The Anglo-Saxon genealogies agree that the son of Sceldwa (Scyld) is
  Beow (Beaw, Beo). In <i>Beowulf</i>, he is named not Beow, but
  Beowulf.</p>

  <p>Many etymologies have been suggested for <i>B&#x113;ow</i>. But
  considering that Beow is in some versions a grandson, in all a descendant
  of Sceaf, it can hardly be an accident that his name is identical with
  the O.E. word for grain, <i>b&#x113;ow</i>. The Norse word corresponding
  to this is <i>bygg</i><a name="NtA194"
  href="#Nt194"><sup>[194]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Recent investigation of the name is best summed up in the words of
  Axel Olrik:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"New light has been cast upon the question of the derivation of the
  name Beow by Kaarle Krohn's investigation of the debt of Finnish to Norse
  mythology, together with Magnus Olsen's linguistic interpretation. The
  Finnish has a deity Pekko, concerning whom it is said that he promoted
  the growth of barley: the Esths, closely akin to the Finns, have a
  corresponding Peko, whose image&mdash;the size of a three-year-old
  child&mdash;was carried out into the fields and invoked at the time of
  sowing, or else was kept in the corn-bin by a custodian chosen for a
  year. This Pekko is plainly a personification of the barley; the form
  corresponding phonetically in Runic Norse would be *<i>beggw-</i> (from
  which comes Old Norse <i>bygg</i>).</p>

  <p>"So in Norse there was a grain *<i>beggw-</i> (becoming <i>bygg</i>)
  and a corn-god *<i>Beggw-</i> (becoming <i>Pekko</i>). In Anglo-Saxon
  there was a grain <i>béow</i> and an ancestral <i>Béow</i>. And all four
  are phonetically identical (proceeding from a primitive form
  *<i>beuwa</i>, 'barley'). The conclusion which it is difficult to avoid
  is, that the corn-spirit 'Barley' and the ancestor 'Barley' are one and
  the same. The relation is the same as that between King Sheaf and the
  worship of the sheaf: the worshipped corn-being gradually sinks into the
  background, and comes to be regarded as an epic figure, an early
  ancestor.</p>

  <p>"We have no more exact knowledge of the mythical ideas connected
  either with the ancestor Beow or the corn-god Pekko. But we know enough
  of the worship of Pekko to show that he dwelt in the corn-heap, and that,
  in the spring, he was fetched out in the shape of a little child. That
  reminds us not a little of Sämpsä, who lay in the corn-heap on the ship,
  and came to land and awoke in the spring<a name="NtA195"
  href="#Nt195"><sup>[195]</sup></a>."</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"></a>{88}</span></p>

  <p>But it may be objected that this is "harking back" to the old
  mythological interpretations. After refusing to accept Müllenhoff's
  assumptions, are we not reverting, through the names of Sceaf and Beow,
  and the worship of the sheaf, to very much the same thing?</p>

  <p>No. It is one thing to believe that the ancestor-king Beow may be a
  weakened form of an ancient divinity, a mere name surviving from the
  figure of an old corn-god Beow; it is quite another to assume, as
  Müllenhoff did, that what we are told about Beowulf was originally told
  about Beow <i>and that therefore we are justified in giving a
  mythological meaning to it</i>.</p>

  <p>All we know, conjecture apart, about Beow is his traditional
  relationship to Scyld, Sceaf and the other figures of the pedigree. That
  Beowulf's dragon fight belonged originally to him is only a conjecture.
  In confirmation of this conjecture only one argument has been put
  forward: an argument turning upon Beowulf, son of Scyld&mdash;that
  obscure figure, apparently equivalent to Beow, who meets us at the
  beginning of our poem.</p>

  <p>Beowulf's place as a son of Scyld and father of Healfdene is occupied
  in the Danish genealogies by Frothi, son of Skjold, and father of
  Halfdan. It has been urged that the two figures are really identical, in
  spite of the difference of name. Now Frothi slays a dragon, and it has
  been argued that this dragon fight shows similarities which enable us to
  identify it with the dragon fight attributed in our poem to Beowulf the
  Geat.</p>

  <p>The argument is a strong one&mdash;if it really is the case that the
  dragon slain by Frothi was the same monster as that slain by Beowulf the
  Geat.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately this parallel, which will be examined in the next
  section, is far from certain. We must be careful not to argue in a
  circle, identifying Beowulf and Frothi because they slew the same dragon,
  and then identifying the dragons because they were slain by the same
  hero.</p>

  <p>Whilst, therefore, we admit that it is highly probable that Beow
  (grain) the descendant of Sceaf (sheaf) was originally a corn divinity or
  corn fetish, we cannot follow Müllenhoff in his bold attribution to this
  "culture hero" of Beowulf's adventures with the dragon or with
  Grendel.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section VII. The house of Scyld and Danish parallels: Heremod-Lotherus and Beowulf-Frotho.</span></p>

  <p>Scyld, although the source of that Scylding dynasty which our poem
  celebrates, is <i>not</i> apparently regarded in <i>Beowulf</i> as the
  earliest Danish king. He came to the throne after an interregnum; the
  people whom he grew up to rule had long endured cruel need, "being
  without a prince<a name="NtA196" href="#Nt196"><sup>[196]</sup></a>." We
  hear in <i>Beowulf</i> of one Danish king only whom we can place
  chronologically before Scyld&mdash;viz. Heremod<a name="NtA197"
  href="#Nt197"><sup>[197]</sup></a>. The way in which Heremod is referred
  to would fit in very well with the supposition<a name="NtA198"
  href="#Nt198"><sup>[198]</sup></a> that he was the last of a dynasty; the
  immediate predecessor of Scyld; and that it was the death or exile of
  Heremod which ushered in the time when the Danes were without a
  prince.</p>

  <p>Now there is a natural tendency in genealogies for each king to be
  represented as the descendant of his predecessor, whether he really was
  so or no; so that in the course of time, and sometimes of a very short
  time, the first king of a new dynasty may come to be reckoned as son of a
  king of the preceding line<a name="NtA199"
  href="#Nt199"><sup>[199]</sup></a>. Consequently, there would be nothing
  surprising if, in another account, we find Scyld represented as a son of
  Heremod. And we <i>do</i> find the matter represented thus in the West
  Saxon genealogy, where Sceldwa or Scyld is son of Heremod. Turning to the
  Danish accounts, however, we do not find any <i>Hermóðr</i> (which is the
  form we should expect corresponding to <i>Herem&#x14D;d</i>) as father to
  Skjold (Scyld). Either no father of Skjold is known, or else (in Saxo
  Grammaticus) he has a father Lotherus. But, although the names are
  different, there is some correspondence between what we are told of
  Lother and what we are told of Heremod. A close parallel has indeed been
  drawn by Sievers between the whole dynasty: on the one hand Lotherus, his
  son Skioldus, and his descendant Frotho, <!-- Page 90 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page90"></a>{90}</span>as given in Saxo: and on
  the other hand the corresponding figures in <i>Beowulf</i>, Heremod,
  Scyld, and Scyld's son, Beowulf the Dane.</p>

  <p>The fixed and certain point here is the identity of the central
  figure, Skioldus-Scyld. All the rest is very doubtful; not that there are
  not many parallel features, but because the parallels are of a
  commonplace type which might so easily recur accidentally.</p>

  <p>The story of Lother, as given by Saxo, will be found below: the story
  of Heremod as given in <i>Beowulf</i> is hopelessly obscure&mdash;a mere
  succession of allusions intended for an audience who knew the tale quite
  well. Assuming the stories of Lother and Heremod to be different versions
  of one original, the following would seem to be the most likely
  reconstruction<a name="NtA200" href="#Nt200"><sup>[200]</sup></a>, the
  more doubtful portions being placed within round brackets thus ( ):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The old Danish prince [Dan in Saxo] has two sons, one a weakling
  [<i>Humblus</i>, Saxo] the other a hero [<i>Lotherus</i>, Saxo:
  <i>Heremod</i>, <i>Beowulf</i>] (who was already in his youth the hope of
  the nation). But after his father's death the elder was (through
  violence) raised to the throne: and Lother-Heremod went into banishment.
  (But under the rule of the weakling the kingdom went to pieces, and thus)
  many a man longed for the return of the exile, as a help against these
  evils. So the hero conquers and deposes the weaker brother. But then his
  faults break forth, his greed and his cruelty: he ceases to be the
  darling and becomes the scourge of his people, till they rise and either
  slay him or drive him again into exile.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>If the stories of Lother and Heremod <i>are</i> connected, we may be
  fairly confident that Heremod, not Lother, was the name of the king in
  the original story.</p>

  <p>For Scandinavian literature does know a Hermoth (<i>Hermóðr</i>),
  though no such adventures are attributed to him as those recorded of
  Heremod in <i>Beowulf</i>. Nevertheless it is probable that this Hermoth
  and Heremod in <i>Beowulf</i> are one and the same, because both heroes
  are linked in some way or other with Sigemund. How these two kings,
  Heremod and Sigemund, came to be connected, we do not know, but we find
  this connection recurring again and again<a name="NtA201"
  href="#Nt201"><sup>[201]</sup></a>. This <i>may</i> be <!-- Page 91
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91"></a>{91}</span>mere
  coincidence: but I doubt if we are justified in assuming it to be so<a
  name="NtA202" href="#Nt202"><sup>[202]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>It has been suggested<a name="NtA203"
  href="#Nt203"><sup>[203]</sup></a> that both Heremod and Sigemund were
  originally heroes specially connected with the worship of Odin, and hence
  grouped together. The history of the Scandinavian Sigmund is bound up
  with that of the magic sword which Odin gave him, and with which he was
  always victorious till the last fight when Odin himself shattered it.</p>

  <p>And we are told in the Icelandic that Odin, whilst he gave a sword to
  Sigmund, gave a helm and byrnie to Hermoth.</p>

  <p>Again, whilst in one Scandinavian poem Sigmund is represented as
  welcoming the newcomer at the gates of Valhalla, in another the same duty
  is entrusted to Hermoth.</p>

  <p>It is clear also that the <i>Beowulf</i>-poet had in mind some kind of
  connection, though we cannot tell what, between Sigemund and Heremod.</p>

  <p>We may take it, then, that the Heremod who is linked with Sigemund in
  <i>Beowulf</i> was also known in Scandinavian literature as a hero in
  some way connected with Sigmund: whether or no the adventures which Saxo
  records of Lotherus were really told in Scandinavian lands in connection
  with Hermoth, we cannot say. The wicked king whose subjects rebel against
  him is too common a feature of Germanic story for us to feel sure,
  without a good deal of corroborative evidence, that the figures of
  Lotherus and Heremod are identical.</p>

  <p>The next king in the line, Skioldus in Saxo, is, as we have seen,
  clearly identical with Scyld in <i>Beowulf</i>. But beyond the name, the
  two traditions have, as we have also seen, but little in common. Both are
  youthful heroes<a name="NtA204" href="#Nt204"><sup>[204]</sup></a>, both
  force neighbouring kings to pay tribute<a name="NtA205"
  href="#Nt205"><sup>[205]</sup></a>; but such things are commonplaces<a
  name="NtA206" href="#Nt206"><sup>[206]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>We must therefore turn to the next figure in the pedigree: the son of
  Skjold in Scandinavian tradition is Frothi (Frotho <!-- Page 92 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page92"></a>{92}</span>in Saxo)<a name="NtA207"
  href="#Nt207"><sup>[207]</sup></a>, the son of Scyld in <i>Beowulf</i> is
  Beowulf the Dane. And Frothi is the father of Halfdan (Haldanus in Saxo)
  as Beowulf the Dane is of Healfdene. The Frothi of Scandinavian tradition
  corresponds then in position to Beowulf the Dane in Old English story<a
  name="NtA208" href="#Nt208"><sup>[208]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Now of Beowulf the Dane we are told so little that we have really no
  means of drawing a comparison between him and Frothi. But a <i>theory</i>
  that has found wide acceptance among scholars assumes that the dragon
  fight of Beowulf the Geat was originally narrated of Beowulf the Dane,
  and only subsequently transferred to the Geatic hero. Theoretically,
  then, Beowulf the Dane kills a dragon. Now certainly Frotho kills a
  dragon: and it has been generally accepted<a name="NtA209"
  href="#Nt209"><sup>[209]</sup></a> that the parallels between the dragon
  slain by Frotho and that slain by Beowulf the Geat are so remarkable as
  to exclude the possibility of mere accidental coincidence, and to lead us
  to conclude that the dragon story was originally told of that Beowulf who
  corresponds to Frothi, i.e. Beowulf the Dane, son of Scyld and father of
  Healfdene; not Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow, the Geat.</p>

  <p>But are the parallels really so close? We must not forget that here we
  are building theory upon theory. That the Frotho of Saxo is the same
  figure as Beowulf the Dane in Old English, is a theory, based upon his
  common relationship to Skiold-Scyld before him and to Haldanus-Healfdene
  coming after him: that Beowulf the Dane was the original hero of the
  dragon fight, and that that dragon fight was only subsequently
  transferred to the credit of Beowulf the Geat, is again a theory. Only if
  we can find real parallels between the dragon-slaying of Frotho and the
  dragon-slaying of Beowulf will these theories have confirmation.</p>

<p><!-- Page 93 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"></a>{93}</span></p>

  <p>Parallels have been pointed out by Sievers which he regards as so
  close as to justify a belief that both are derived ultimately from an old
  lay, with so much closeness that verbal resemblances can still be
  traced.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately the parallels are all commonplaces. That Sievers and
  others have been satisfied with them was perhaps due to the fact that
  they started by assuming as proved that the dragon fight of Beowulf the
  Geat belonged originally to Beowulf the Dane<a name="NtA210"
  href="#Nt210"><sup>[210]</sup></a>, and argued that since Frotho in Saxo
  occupies a place corresponding exactly to that of Beowulf the Dane in
  <i>Beowulf</i>, a comparatively limited resemblance between two dragons
  coming, as it were, at the same point in the pedigree, might be held
  sufficient to identify them.</p>

  <p>But, as we have seen, the assumption that the dragon fight of Beowulf
  the Geat belonged originally to Beowulf the Dane is only a theory that
  will have to stand or fall as we can prove that the dragon fight of
  Frotho is really parallel to that of Beowulf the Geat, and therefore must
  have belonged to the connecting link supplied by the Scylding prince
  Beowulf the Dane. In other words, the theory that the dragon in
  <i>Beowulf</i> is to be identified with the dragon which in Saxo is slain
  by Frotho the Danish prince, father of Haldanus-Healfdene, is one of the
  main arguments upon which we must base the theory that the dragon in
  <i>Beowulf</i> was originally slain by the Danish Beowulf, father of
  Healfdene, not by Beowulf the Geat. We cannot then turn round, and assert
  that the fact that they were both slain by a Danish prince, the father of
  Healfdene, is an argument for identifying the dragons.</p>

  <p>Turning to the dragon fight itself, the following parallels have been
  noted by Sievers:</p>

  <p>(1) A native (<i>indigena</i>) comes to Frotho, and tells him of the
  treasure-guarding dragon. An informer (<i>melda</i>) plays the same part
  in <i>Beowulf</i><a name="NtA211" href="#Nt211"><sup>[211]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>But a dragon is not game which can be met with every day. He is a shy
  beast, lurking in desert places. Some informant has very frequently to
  guide the hero to his <!-- Page 94 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page94"></a>{94}</span>foe<a name="NtA212"
  href="#Nt212"><sup>[212]</sup></a>. And the situation is widely
  different. Frotho knows nothing of the dragon till directed to the spot:
  Beowulf's land has been assailed, he knows of the dragon, though he needs
  to be guided to its <i>exact</i> lair.</p>

  <p>(2) Frotho's dragon lives on an island. Beowulf's lives near the sea,
  and there is an island (<i>&#x113;alond</i>, 2334) in the
  neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>But <i>&#x113;alond</i> in <i>Beowulf</i> probably does not mean
  "island" at all: and in any case the dragon did not live upon the
  <i>&#x113;alond</i>. Many dragons have lived near the sea. Sigemund's
  dragon did so<a name="NtA213" href="#Nt213"><sup>[213]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>(3) The hero in each case attacks the dragon single-handed.</p>

  <p>But what hero ever did otherwise? On the contrary, Beowulf's exploit
  differs from that of Frotho and of most other dragon slayers in that he
  is unable to <i>overcome</i> his foe single-handed, and needs the support
  of Wiglaf.</p>

  <p>(4) Special armour is carried by the dragon slayer in each case.</p>

  <p>But this again is no uncommon feature. The Red Cross Knight also needs
  special armour. Dragon slayers constantly invent some ingenious or even
  unique method. And again the parallel is far from close. Frotho is
  advised to cover his shield and his limbs with the hides of bulls and
  kine: a sensible precaution against fiery venom. Beowulf constructs a
  shield of iron<a name="NtA214" href="#Nt214"><sup>[214]</sup></a>: which
  naturally gives very inferior protection<a name="NtA215"
  href="#Nt215"><sup>[215]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>(5) Frotho's informant tells him that he must be of good courage<a
  name="NtA216" href="#Nt216"><sup>[216]</sup></a>. Wiglaf encourages
  Beowulf<a name="NtA217" href="#Nt217"><sup>[217]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>But the circumstances under which the words are uttered are entirely
  different, nor have the words more than a general resemblance. That a man
  needs courage, if he is going to tackle a dragon, is surely a conclusion
  at which two minds could have arrived independently.</p>

  <p>(6) Both heroes waste their blows at first on the scaly back of the
  dragon.</p>

<p><!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"></a>{95}</span></p>

  <p>But if the hero went at once for the soft parts, there would be no
  fight at all, and all the fun would be lost. Sigurd's dragon-fight is,
  for this reason, a one-sided business from the first. To avoid this,
  Frotho is depicted as beginning by an attack on the dragon's rough hide
  (although he has been specially warned by the <i>indigena</i> not to do
  so):</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i24">ventre sub imo</p>
      <p>esse locum scito quo ferrum mergere fas est,</p>
      <p>hunc mucrone petens medium rimaberis anguem<a name="NtA218" href="#Nt218"><sup>[218]</sup></a>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>(7) The hoard is plundered by both heroes.</p>

  <p>But it is the nature of a dragon to guard a hoard<a name="NtA219"
  href="#Nt219"><sup>[219]</sup></a>. And, having slain the dragon, what
  hero would neglect the gold?</p>

  <p>(8) There are many verbal resemblances: the dragon spits venom<a
  name="NtA220" href="#Nt220"><sup>[220]</sup></a>, and twists himself into
  coils<a name="NtA221" href="#Nt221"><sup>[221]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Some of these verbal resemblances may be granted as proved: but they
  surely do not prove the common origin of the two dragon fights. They only
  tend to prove the common origin of the school of poetry in which these
  two dragon fights were told. That dragons dwelt in mounds was a common
  Germanic belief, to which the Cottonian Gnomic verses testify. Naturally,
  therefore, Frotho's dragon is <i>montis possessor</i>: Beowulf's is
  <i>beorges hyrde</i>. The two phrases undoubtedly point back to a similar
  gradus, to a similar traditional stock phraseology, and to similar
  beliefs: that is all. As well argue that two kings must be identical,
  because each is called <i>folces hyrde</i>.</p>

  <p>These commonplace phrases and commonplace features are surely quite
  insufficient to prove that the stories are identical&mdash;at most they
  only prove that they bear the impress of one and the same poetical
  school. If a parallel is to carry weight there must be something
  individual about it, as there is, for example, about the arguments by
  which the identity of Beowulf and Bjarki have been supported. That a hero
  comes from <!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page96"></a>{96}</span>Geatland (Gautland) to the court where
  Hrothulf (Rolf) is abiding; that the same hero subsequently is
  instrumental in helping Eadgils (Athils) against Onela (Ali)&mdash;here
  we have something tangible. But when two heroes, engaged upon slaying a
  dragon, are each told to be brave, the parallel is too general to be a
  parallel at all. "There is a river in Macedon: and there is also moreover
  a river at Monmouth, and there is salmons in both."</p>

  <p>And there is a fundamental difference, which would serve to neutralize
  the parallels, even did they appear much less accidental than they
  do.</p>

  <p>Dragon fights may be classified into several types: two stand out
  prominently. There is the story in which the young hero begins his career
  by slaying a dragon or monster and winning, it may be a hoard of gold, it
  may be a bride. This is the type of story found, for instance, in the
  tales of Sigurd, or Perseus, or St George. On the other hand there is the
  hero who, at the end of his career, seeks to ward off evil from himself
  and his people. He slays the monster, but is himself slain by it. The
  great example of this type is the god Thor, who in the last fight of the
  gods slays the Dragon, but dies when he has reeled back nine paces from
  the "baleful serpent<a name="NtA222"
  href="#Nt222"><sup>[222]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p>Now the story of the victorious young Frotho is of the one type: that
  of the aged Beowulf is of the other. And this difference is essential,
  fundamental, dominating the whole situation in each case: giving its
  cheerful and aggressive tone to the story of Frotho, giving the elegiac
  and pathetic note which runs through the whole of the last portion of
  <i>Beowulf</i><a name="NtA223" href="#Nt223"><sup>[223]</sup></a>. It is
  no mere detail which could be added or subtracted by a narrator without
  altering the essence of the story.</p>

  <p>In face of this we must pronounce the two stories essentially and
  originally distinct. If, nevertheless, there were a large number of
  striking and specific similarities, we should have to allow that, though
  originally distinct, the one dragon story had influenced the other in
  detail. For, whilst each poet who retold the tale would make alterations
  in detail, and might <!-- Page 97 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page97"></a>{97}</span>import such detail from one dragon story
  into another, what we know of the method of the ancient story tellers
  does not allow us to assume that a poet would have altered the whole
  drift of a story, either by changing the last death-struggle of an aged,
  childless prince into the victorious feat of a young hero, or by the
  reverse process.</p>

  <p>Those, therefore, who hold the parallels quoted above to be
  convincing, may believe that one dragon story has influenced another,
  originally distinct<a name="NtA224" href="#Nt224"><sup>[224]</sup></a>.
  To me, it does not appear that even this necessarily follows from the
  evidence.</p>

  <p>It seems very doubtful whether any of the parallels drawn by Sievers
  between the stories of Lotherus and Heremod<a name="NtA225"
  href="#Nt225"><sup>[225]</sup></a>, Skioldus and Scyld, Frotho and
  Beowulf, are more than the resemblances inevitable in poetry which, like
  the Old Danish and the Old English, still retains so many traces of the
  common Germanic frame in which it was moulded.</p>

  <p>Indeed, of the innumerable dragon-stories extant, there is probably
  not one which we can declare to be really identical with that of Beowulf.
  There is a Danish tradition which shows many similarities<a name="NtA226"
  href="#Nt226"><sup>[226]</sup></a>, and I have given this below, in Part
  II; but rather as an example of a dragon-slaying of the <i>Beowulf</i>
  type, than because I believe in any direct connection between the two
  stories.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THEORIES AS TO THE ORIGIN, DATE, AND
STRUCTURE OF THE POEM</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section I. Is "Beowulf" Translated from a Scandinavian original?</span></p>

  <p>Our poem, the first original poem of any length in the English tongue,
  ignores England. In one remarkable passage (ll. 1931-62) it mentions with
  praise Offa I, the great king who ruled the Angles whilst they were still
  upon the Continent. But, except for this, it deals mainly with heroes
  who, so far as we can identify them with historic figures, are
  Scandinavian.</p>

  <p>Hence, not unnaturally, the first editor boldly declared
  <i>Beowulf</i> to be an Anglo-Saxon version of a Danish poem; and this
  view has had many supporters. The poem <i>must</i> be Scandinavian, said
  one of its earliest translators, because it deals mainly with
  Scandinavian heroes and "everyone knows that in ancient times each nation
  celebrated in song its own heroes alone<a name="NtA227"
  href="#Nt227"><sup>[227]</sup></a>." And this idea, though not so crudely
  expressed, seems really to underlie the belief which has been held by
  numerous scholars, that the poem is nothing more than a translation of a
  poem in which some Scandinavian minstrel had glorified the heroes of his
  own nation.</p>

  <p>But what do we mean by "nation"? Doubtless, from the point of view of
  politics and war, each Germanic tribe, or offshoot of a tribe, formed an
  independent nation: the Longobardi had no hesitation in helping the
  "Romans" to cut the throats of their Gothic kinsmen: Penda the Mercian
  was willing to ally with the Welshmen in order to overthrow his <!-- Page
  99 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page99"></a>{99}</span>fellow Angles
  of Northumbria. But all this, as the history of the ancient Greeks or of
  the ancient Hebrews might show us, is quite compatible with a
  consciousness of racial unity among the warring states, with a common
  poetic tradition and a common literature. For purposes of poetry there
  was only one nation&mdash;the Germanic&mdash;split into many dialects and
  groups, but possessed of a common metre, a common style, a common
  standard of heroic feeling: and any deed of valour performed by any
  Germanic chief might become a fit subject for the poetry of any Germanic
  tribe of the heroic age.</p>

  <p>So, if by "nation" we mean the whole Germanic race, then Germanic
  poetry is essentially "national." The Huns were the only non-Germanic
  tribe who were received (for poetical purposes) into Germania. Hunnish
  chiefs seem to have adopted Gothic manners, and after the Huns had
  disappeared it often came to be forgotten that they were not Germans. But
  with this exception the tribes and heroes of Germanic heroic poetry are
  Germanic.</p>

  <p>If, however, by "nation" we understand the different warring units
  into which the Germanic race was, politically speaking, divided, then
  Germanic poetry is essentially "international."</p>

  <p>This is no theory, but a fact capable of conclusive proof. The chief
  actors in the old Norse Volsung lays are not Norsemen, but Sigurd the
  Frank, Gunnar the Burgundian, Atli the Hun. In Continental Germany, the
  ideal knight of the Saxons in the North and the Bavarians in the South
  was no native hero, but Theodoric the Ostrogoth. So too in England,
  whilst <i>Beowulf</i> deals chiefly with Scandinavian heroes, the
  <i>Finnsburg</i> fragment deals with the Frisian tribes of the North Sea
  coast: <i>Waldere</i> with the adventures of Germanic chiefs settled in
  Gaul, <i>Deor</i> with stories of the Goths and of the Baltic tribes,
  whilst <i>Widsith</i>, which gives us a catalogue of the old heroic
  tales, shows that amongst the heroes whose names were current in England
  were men of Gothic, Burgundian, Frankish, Lombard, Frisian, Danish and
  Swedish race. There is nothing peculiar, then, in the fact that
  <i>Beowulf</i> celebrates heroes who were not of Anglian birth. <!-- Page
  100 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"></a>{100}</span></p>

  <p>In their old home in Schleswig the Angles had been in the exact centre
  of Germania: with an outlook upon both the North Sea and the Baltic, and
  in touch with Scandinavian tribes on the North and Low German peoples on
  the South. That the Angles were interested in the stories of all the
  nations which surrounded them, and that they brought these stories with
  them to England, is certain. It is a mere accident that the one heroic
  poem which happens to have been preserved at length is almost exclusively
  concerned with Scandinavian doings. It could easily have happened that
  the history of the <i>Beowulf</i> <span class="scac">MS</span> and the
  <i>Waldere</i> <span class="scac">MS</span> might have been reversed:
  that the <i>Beowulf</i> might have been cut up to bind other books, and
  the <i>Waldere</i> preserved intact: in that case our one long poem would
  have been localized in ancient Burgundia, and would have dealt chiefly
  with the doings of Burgundian champions. But we should have had no more
  reason, without further evidence, to suppose the <i>Waldere</i> a
  translation from the Burgundian than we have, without further evidence,
  to suppose <i>Beowulf</i> a translation from the Scandinavian.</p>

  <p>To deny that <i>Beowulf</i>, as we have it, is a translation from the
  Scandinavian does not, of course, involve any denial of the Scandinavian
  origin of the <i>story</i> of Beowulf's deeds. The fact that his
  achievements are framed in a Scandinavian setting, and that the closest
  parallels to them have to be sought in Scandinavian lands, makes it
  probable on <i>a priori</i> grounds that the story had its origin there.
  On the face of it, Müllenhoff's belief that the story was indigenous
  among the Angles is quite unlikely. It would seem rather to have
  originated in the Geatic country. But stories, whether in prose or verse,
  would spread quickly from the Geatas to the Danes and from the Danes to
  the Angles.</p>

  <p>After the Angles had crossed the North Sea, however, this close
  intimacy ceased, till the Viking raids again reminded Englishmen, in a
  very unpleasant way, of their kinsmen across the sea. Now linguistic
  evidence tends to show that <i>Beowulf</i> belongs to a time prior to the
  Viking settlement in England, and it is unlikely that the Scandinavian
  traditions embodied in <i>Beowulf</i> found their way to England just at
  the time when <!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page101"></a>{101}</span>communication with Scandinavian lands
  seems to have been suspended. We must conclude then that all this
  Scandinavian tradition probably spread to the Angles whilst they were
  still in their old continental home, was brought across to England by the
  settlers in the sixth century, was handed on by English bards from
  generation to generation, till some Englishmen formed the poem of
  <i>Beowulf</i> as we know it.</p>

  <p>Of course, if evidence can be produced that <i>Beowulf</i> is
  translated from some Scandinavian original, which was brought over in the
  seventh century or later, that is another matter. But the evidence
  produced so far is not merely inconclusive, but ludicrously
  inadequate.</p>

  <p>It has been urged<a name="NtA228" href="#Nt228"><sup>[228]</sup></a>
  by Sarrazin, the chief advocate of the translation theory, that the
  description of the country round Heorot, and especially of the journey to
  the Grendel-lake, shows such local knowledge as to point to its having
  been composed by some Scandinavian poet familiar with the locality.
  Heorot can probably, as we have seen, be identified with Leire: and the
  Grendel-lake Sarrazin identifies with the neighbouring Roskilde fjord.
  But it is hardly possible to conceive a greater contrast than that
  between the Roskilde fjord and the scenery depicted in ll. 1357
  <i>etc.</i>, 1408 <i>etc.</i> Seen, as Sarrazin saw it, on a May morning,
  in alternate sun and shadow, the Roskilde fjord presents a view of tame
  and peaceful beauty. In the days of Hrothgar, when there were perhaps
  fewer cultivated fields and more beech forests, the scenery may have been
  less tame, but can hardly have been less peaceful. The only trace of
  accurate geography is that Heorot is represented as not on the shore, and
  yet not far remote from it (ll. 307 <i>etc.</i>). But, as has been
  pointed out above, we know that traditions of the attack by the
  Heathobeardan upon Heorot were current in England: and these would be
  quite sufficient to keep alive, even among English bards, some
  remembrance of the strategic situation of Heorot with regard to the sea.
  A man need not have been near Troy, to realize that the town was no
  seaport and yet near the sea.</p>

<p><!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"></a>{102}</span></p>

  <p>Again, it has been claimed by Sarrazin that the language of
  <i>Beowulf</i> shows traces of the Scandinavian origin of the poem.
  Sarrazin's arguments on this head have been contested energetically by
  Sievers<a name="NtA229" href="#Nt229"><sup>[229]</sup></a>. After some
  heated controversy Sarrazin made a final and (presumably)
  carefully-weighed statement of his case. In this he gave a list of
  twenty-nine words upon which he based his belief<a name="NtA230"
  href="#Nt230"><sup>[230]</sup></a>. Yet of these twenty-nine, twenty-one
  occur in other O.E. writings, where there can be no possible question of
  translation from the Scandinavian: some of these words, in fact, are
  amongst the commonest of O.E. poetical expressions. There remain eight
  which do not happen to be found elsewhere in the extant remains of O.E.
  poetry. But these are mostly compounds like <i>heaðo-l&#x101;c</i>,
  <i>feorh-s&#x113;oc</i>: and though the actual compound is not elsewhere
  extant in English, the component elements are thoroughly English. There
  is no reason whatever to think that these eight rare words are taken from
  Old Norse. Indeed, three of them do not occur in Old Norse at all.</p>

  <p>Evidence to prove <i>Beowulf</i> a translation from a Scandinavian
  original is, then, wanting. On the other hand, over and above the
  difficulty that the <i>Beowulf</i> belongs just to the period when
  intimate communication between the Angles and Scandinavians was
  suspended, there is much evidence against the translation theory. The
  earliest Scandinavian poetry we possess, or of which we can get
  information, differs absolutely from <i>Beowulf</i> in style, metre and
  sentiment: the manners of <i>Beowulf</i> are incompatible with all we
  know of the wild heathendom of Scandinavia in the seventh or eighth
  century<a name="NtA231" href="#Nt231"><sup>[231]</sup></a>.
  <i>Beowulf</i>, as we now have it, with its Christian references and its
  Latin loan-words, <i>could</i> not be a translation from the
  Scandinavian. And the proper names in <i>Beowulf</i> which Sarrazin
  claimed were Old Norse, not Old English, and had been taken <!-- Page 103
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"></a>{103}</span>over from the
  Old Norse original, are in all cases so correctly transliterated as to
  necessitate the assumption that they were brought across early, at the
  time of the settlement of Britain or very shortly after, and underwent
  phonetic development side by side with the other words in the English
  language. Had they been brought across from Scandinavia at a later date,
  much confusion must have ensued in the forms.</p>

  <p>Somewhat less improbable is the suggestion "that the poet had
  travelled on the continent and become familiar with the legends of the
  Danes and Geats, or else had heard them from a Scandinavian resident in
  England<a name="NtA232" href="#Nt232"><sup>[232]</sup></a>." But it is
  clear from the allusive manner in which the Scandinavian tales are told,
  that they must have been familiar to the poet's audience. If, then, the
  English audience knew them, why must the poet himself have travelled on
  the continent in order to know them? There is, therefore, no need for
  this theory, and it is open to many of the objections of the translation
  theory: for example it fails, equally with that theory, to account for
  the uniformly correct development of the proper names.</p>

  <p>The obvious conclusion is that these Scandinavian traditions were
  brought over by the English settlers in the sixth century. Against this
  only one cavil can be raised, and that will not bear examination. It has
  been objected that, since Hygelac's raid took place about 516, since
  Beowulf's accession was some years subsequent, and since he then reigned
  fifty years, his death cannot be put much earlier than 575, and that this
  brings us to a date when the migration of the Angles and Saxons had been
  completed<a name="NtA233" href="#Nt233"><sup>[233]</sup></a>. But it is
  forgotten that all the historical events mentioned in the poem, which we
  can date, occur before, or not very long after, the raid of Hygelac, c.
  516. The poem asserts that fifty years after these events Beowulf slew a
  dragon and was slain by it. But this does not make the dragon historic,
  nor does it make the year 575 the historic date of the death of Beowulf.
  We cannot be sure that there <i>was</i> any actual king of the Geatas
  named Beowulf; and if there was, the last known historic act with which
  that king is associated is the raising of Eadgils to the Swedish throne,
  <!-- Page 104 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page104"></a>{104}</span>c. 525: the rest of Beowulf's long reign,
  since it contains no event save the slaying of a dragon, has no historic
  validity.</p>

  <p>It is noteworthy that, whereas there is full knowledge shown in our
  poem of those events which took place in Scandinavian lands during the
  whole period from about 450 to 530&mdash;the period during which hordes
  of Angles, Saxons and Jutes were landing in Britain&mdash;there is no
  reference, not even by way of casual allusion, to any continental events
  which we can date with certainty as subsequent to the arrival of the
  latest settlers from the continent. Surely this is strong evidence that
  these tales were brought over by some of the last of the invaders, not
  carried to England by some casual traveller a century or two later.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section II. The dialect, syntax, and metre of "Beowulf" as evidence of its literary history.</span></p>

  <p>A full discussion of the dialect, metre and syntax of <i>Beowulf</i>
  forms no part of the scheme of this study. It is only intended in this
  section to see how far such investigations throw light upon the literary
  history of the poem.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Dialect.</i></p>

  <p><i>Beowulf</i> is written in the late West Saxon dialect. Imbedded in
  the poem, however, are a large number of forms, concerning which this at
  least can be said&mdash;that they are not normal late West Saxon. Critics
  have classified these forms, and have drawn conclusions from them as to
  the history of the poem: arguing from sporadic "Mercian" and "Kentish"
  forms that <i>Beowulf</i> is of Mercian origin and has passed through the
  hands of a Kentish transcriber.</p>

  <p>But, in fact, the evidence as to Old English dialects is more scanty
  and more conflicting than philologists have always been willing to admit.
  It is exceedingly difficult to say with any certainty what forms are
  "Mercian" and what "Kentish." Having run such forms to earth, it is still
  more difficult to say what arguments are to be drawn from their
  <i>occasional</i> <!-- Page 105 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page105"></a>{105}</span>appearance in any text. Men from widely
  different parts of the country would be working together in the
  scriptorium of one and the same monastery, and this fact alone may have
  often led to confusion in the dialectal forms of works transcribed.</p>

  <p>A thorough investigation of the significance of all the abnormal forms
  in <i>Beowulf</i> has still to be made. Whether it would repay the labour
  of the investigator may well be questioned. In the meantime we may accept
  the view that the poem was in all probability originally written in some
  non-West-Saxon dialect, and most probably in an Anglian dialect, since
  this is confirmed by the way in which the Anglian hero Offa is dragged
  into the story.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Ten Brink's attempt to decide the dialect and transmission of
  <i>Beowulf</i> will be found in his <i>Beowulf</i>, pp. 237-241: he notes
  the difficulty that the "Kentish" forms from which he argues are nearly
  all such as occur also sporadically in West Saxon texts. A classification
  of the forms by P. G. Thomas will be found in the <i>Modern Language

<p class="cenhead">"<i>Lichtenheld's Test.</i>"</p>

  <p>Somewhat more definite results can be drawn from certain syntactical
  usages. There can be no doubt that as time went on, the use of <i>se</i>,
  <i>s&#x113;o</i>, <i>þæt</i> became more and more common in O.E. verse.
  This is largely due to the fact that in the older poems the <i>weak
  adjective</i> + <i>noun</i> appears frequently where we should now use
  the definite article: <i>w&#x12B;sa fengel</i>&mdash;"the wise prince";
  <i>se w&#x12B;sa fengel</i> is used where some demonstrative is
  needed&mdash;"that wise prince." Later, however, <i>se</i>,
  <i>s&#x113;o</i>, <i>þæt</i> comes to be used in the common and vague
  sense in which the definite article is used in Modern English.</p>

  <p>We consequently get with increasing frequency the use of the
  <i>definite article</i> + <i>weak adjective</i> + <i>noun</i>: whilst the
  usage <i>weak adjective</i> + <i>noun</i> decreases. Some rough criterion
  of date can thus be obtained by an examination of a poet's usage in this
  particular. Of course it would be absurd&mdash;as has been done&mdash;to
  group Old English poems in a strict chronological order according to the
  proportion of forms with and without the article. Individual usage must
  count for a good deal: <!-- Page 106 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page106"></a>{106}</span>also the scribes in copying and recopying
  our text must to a considerable extent have obliterated the earlier
  practice. Metre and syntax combine to make it probable that, in line 9 of
  our poem, the scribe has inserted the unnecessary article
  <i>þ&#x101;ra</i> before <i>ymbsittendra</i>: and in the rare cases where
  we have an O.E. poem preserved in two texts, a comparison proves that the
  scribe has occasionally interpolated an article. But this later tendency
  to level out the peculiarity only makes it the more remarkable that we
  should find such great differences between O.E. poems, all of them extant
  in copies transcribed about the year 1000.</p>

  <p>How great is the difference between the usage of <i>Beowulf</i> and
  that of the great body of Old English poetry will be clear from the
  following statistics.</p>

  <p>The proportion of phrases containing the weak adjective + noun with
  and without the definite article in the certain works of Cynewulf is as
  follows<a name="NtA234" href="#Nt234"><sup>[234]</sup></a>:</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Use of article" title="Use of article">
<tr><td class="spacsingle" style="width:33%;"> </td><td class="spacsingle" style="text-align:center; width:33%;"> With article </td><td class="spacsingle" style="text-align:center; width:33%;"> Without article</td></tr>

</table>

  <p>In <i>Guthlac</i> (A) (c. 750) the proportions are:</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Use of article" title="Use of article">
<tr><td class="spacsingle" style="width:33%;"> </td><td class="spacsingle" style="text-align:center; width:33%;"> With article </td><td class="spacsingle" style="text-align:center; width:33%;"> Without article</td></tr>

</table>

  <p>Contrast this with the proportion in our poem:</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Use of article" title="Use of article">
<tr><td class="spacsingle" style="width:33%;"> </td><td class="spacsingle" style="text-align:center; width:33%;"> With article </td><td class="spacsingle" style="text-align:center; width:33%;"> Without article</td></tr>

  <p>The nearest approach to the proportions of <i>Beowulf</i> is in the
  (certainly very archaic)</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Use of article" title="Use of article">

</table>

  <p>On the other hand, certain late texts show how fallible this criterion
  is. Anyone dating <i>Maldon</i> solely by "Lichtenheld's Test" would
  assuredly place it much earlier than 991.</p>

<p><!-- Page 107 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>{107}</span></p>

  <p>It is easy to make a false use of grammatical statistics: and this
  test should only be applied with the greatest caution. But the difference
  between <i>Beowulf</i> and the works of Cynewulf is too striking to be
  overlooked. In <i>Beowulf</i>, to every five examples without the article
  (e.g. <i>heaðo-st&#x113;apa helm</i>) we have <i>one</i> with the article
  (e.g. <i>se hearda helm</i>): in Cynewulf to every five examples without
  the article we have <i>forty</i> with it.</p>

  <p>A further test of antiquity is in the use of the weak adjective with
  the instrumental&mdash;a use which rapidly diminishes.</p>

  <p>There are eighteen such instrumental phrases in <i>Beowulf</i> (3182
  lines)<a name="NtA235" href="#Nt235"><sup>[235]</sup></a>. In
  <i>Exodus</i> (589 lines) there are six examples<a name="NtA236"
  href="#Nt236"><sup>[236]</sup></a>&mdash;proportionally more than in
  <i>Beowulf</i>. In Cynewulf's undoubted works (c. 2478 lines) there is
  one example only, <i>beorhtan reorde</i><a name="NtA237"
  href="#Nt237"><sup>[237]</sup></a>.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>This criterion of the absence of the definite article before the weak
  adjective is often referred to as Lichtenheld's Test (see article by him
  in <i>Z.f.d.A.</i> <span class="scac">XVI</span>, 325 <i>etc.</i>). It
  has been applied to the whole body of O.E. poetry by Barnouw
  (<i>Textcritische Untersuchungen</i>, 1902). The data collected by
  Barnouw are most valuable, but we must be cautious in the conclusions we
  draw, as is shown by Sarrazin (<i>Eng. Stud.</i> <span
  class="scac">XXXVIII</span>, 145 <i>etc.</i>), and Tupper (<i>Pub. Mod.
  Lang. Assoc.</i> <span class="scac">XXVI</span>, 274).</p>

  <p>Exact enumeration of instances is difficult. For example, Lichtenheld
  gave 22 instances of definite article + weak adjective + noun in
  <i>Beowulf</i><a name="NtA238" href="#Nt238"><sup>[238]</sup></a>. But
  eight of these are not quite certain; <i>se g&#x14D;da m&#x1E3;g
  Hygel&#x101;ces</i> may be not "the good kinsman of Hygelac," but "the
  good one&mdash;the kinsman of Hygelac," for there is the half line pause
  after <i>g&#x14D;da</i>. These eight examples therefore should be
  deducted<a name="NtA239" href="#Nt239"><sup>[239]</sup></a>. One
  instance, though practically certain, is the result of conjectural

  three are variations of the same phrase.</p>

  upon those of Barnouw.</p>

<p class="cenhead">"<i>Morsbach's Test.</i>"</p>

  <p>Sievers' theories as to O.E. metre have not been accepted by all
  scholars in their entirety. But the statistics which he <!-- Page 108
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"></a>{108}</span>collected
  enable us to say, with absolute certainty, that some given types of verse
  were not acceptable to the ear of an Old English bard.</p>

  <p>Sceptics may emphasize the fact that Old English texts are uncertain,
  that nearly all poems are extant in one <span class="scac">MS</span>
  only, that the <span class="scac">MS</span> in each case was written down
  long after the poems were composed, and that precise verbal accuracy is
  therefore not to be expected<a name="NtA242"
  href="#Nt242"><sup>[242]</sup></a>. All the more remarkable then becomes
  the fact, for it is a fact, that there are certain types of line which
  never occur in <i>Beowulf</i>, and that there are other types which are
  exceedingly rare. Again, there are certain types of line which <i>do</i>
  occur in <i>Beowulf</i> as we have it, though they seem contrary to the
  principles of O.E. scansion. When we find that such lines consistently
  contain some word which had a different metrical value when our extant
  <span class="scac">MS</span> of <i>Beowulf</i> was transcribed, from that
  which it had at the earlier date when <i>Beowulf</i> was composed, and
  that the earlier value makes the line metrical, the conclusion is
  obvious. <i>Beowulf</i> must have been composed at a time or in a dialect
  when the earlier metrical values held good.</p>

  <p>But we reach a certain date beyond which, if we put the language back
  into its older form, it will no longer fit into the metrical structure.
  For example, words like <i>fl&#x14D;d</i>, <i>feld</i>, <i>eard</i> were
  originally "u-nouns": with nom. and acc. sing. <i>fl&#x14D;du</i>, etc.
  But the half-line <i>ofer fealone fl&#x14D;d</i> (1950) becomes
  exceedingly difficult if we put it in the form <i>ofer fealone
  fl&#x14D;du</i><a name="NtA243" href="#Nt243"><sup>[243]</sup></a>: the
  half-line <i>f&#x12B;felcynnes eard</i> becomes absolutely impossible in
  the form <i>f&#x12B;felcynnes eardu</i><a name="NtA244"
  href="#Nt244"><sup>[244]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>It can, consequently, with some certainty be argued that these
  half-lines were composed after the time when <i>fl&#x14D;du</i>,
  <i>eardu</i> had become <i>fl&#x14D;d</i>, <i>eard</i>. Therefore, it has
  been further argued, <i>Beowulf</i> was composed after that date. But are
  we justified in this further step&mdash;in assuming that because a
  certain number of half-lines in <i>Beowulf</i> must have been composed
  after a certain date, therefore <i>Beowulf</i> itself must have been
  composed after that date?</p>

<p><!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"></a>{109}</span></p>

  <p>From what we know of the mechanical way in which the Old English
  <i>scribe</i> worked, we have no reason to suppose that he would have
  consistently altered what he found in an older copy, so as to make it
  metrical according to the later speech into which he was transcribing it.
  But if we go back to a time when poems were committed to memory by a
  <i>scop</i>, skilled in the laws of O.E. metre, the matter is very
  different. A written poem may be copied word for word, even though the
  spelling is at the same time modernized, but it is obvious that a poem
  preserved orally will be altered slightly from time to time, if the
  language in which it is written is undergoing changes which make the poem
  no longer metrically correct.</p>

  <p>Imagine the state of things at the period when final <i>u</i> was
  being lost after a long syllable. This loss of a syllable would make a
  large number of the half-lines and formulas in the old poetry unmetrical.
  Are we to suppose that the whole of O.E. poetry was at once scrapped, and
  entirely new poems composed to fit in with the new sound laws? Surely
  not; old formulas would be recast, old lines modified where they needed
  it, but the old poetry would go on<a name="NtA245"
  href="#Nt245"><sup>[245]</sup></a>, with these minor verbal changes
  adapting it to the new order of things. We can see this taking place, to
  a limited extent, in the transcripts of Middle English poems. In the
  transmission of poems by word of mouth it would surely take place to such
  an extent as to baffle later investigation<a name="NtA246"
  href="#Nt246"><sup>[246]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Consequently I am inclined to agree that this test is hardly final
  except "on the assumption that the poems were written down from the very
  beginning<a name="NtA247" href="#Nt247"><sup>[247]</sup></a>." And we are
  clearly not justified in making any such assumption. A small number of
  such lines would accordingly give, not so much a means of fixing a period
  before which <i>Beowulf</i> cannot have been composed, as merely <!--
  Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page110"></a>{110}</span>one
  before which <i>Beowulf</i> cannot have been fixed by writing in its
  present form.</p>

  <p>If, however, more elaborate investigation were to show that the
  <i>percentage</i> of such lines is <i>just as great</i> in <i>Beowulf</i>
  as it is in poems certainly written after the sound changes had taken
  place, it might be conceded that the test was a valid one, and that it
  proved <i>Beowulf</i> to have been written after these sound changes
  occurred.</p>

  <p>This would then bring us to our second difficulty. At what date
  exactly did these sound changes take place? The chief documents available
  are the proper names in Bede's History, and in certain Latin charters,
  the glosses, and a few early runic inscriptions. Most important, although
  very scanty, are the charters, since they bear a date. With these we
  proceed to investigate:</p>

  <p>A. The dropping of the <i>u</i> after a long accented syllable
  (<i>fl&#x14D;<span class="x1"><span class="x5">&#xB4;</span></span>du</i>
  becoming <i>fl&#x14D;<span class="x1"><span
  class="x5">&#xB4;</span></span>d</i>), or semi-accented syllable
  (<i>St&#x101;<span class="x1"><span
  class="x5">&#xB4;</span></span>nfòrdu</i> becoming <i>St&#x101;<span
  class="x1"><span class="x5">&#xB4;</span></span>nfòrd</i>).</p>

  <p>There is evidence from an Essex charter that this was already lost in
  692 or 693 (<i>uuidmundesfelt</i>)<a name="NtA248"
  href="#Nt248"><sup>[248]</sup></a>. From this date on, examples without
  the <i>u</i> are forthcoming in increasing number<a name="NtA249"
  href="#Nt249"><sup>[249]</sup></a>. One certain example only has been
  claimed for the preservation of <i>u</i>. In the runic inscription on the
  "Franks casket" <i>flodu</i> is found for <i>flod</i>. But the spelling
  of the Franks casket is erratic: for example <i>giuþeasu</i> is also
  found for <i>giuþeas</i>, "the Jews." Now <i>u</i> here is impossible<a
  name="NtA250" href="#Nt250"><sup>[250]</sup></a>, and we must conclude
  perhaps that the inscriber of the runes intended to write <i>giuþea
  su[mæ]</i><a href="#Nt250"><sup>[250]</sup></a> or <i>giuþea su[na]</i><a
  name="NtA251" href="#Nt251"><sup>[251]</sup></a>, "some of the Jews,"
  "the sons of the Jews," and that having reached the end of his line at
  <i>u</i>, he neglected to complete the word: or else perhaps that he
  wrote <i>giuþeas</i> and having some additional space added a <i>u</i> at
  the end of his line, just for fun. Whichever explanation we <!-- Page 111
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111"></a>{111}</span>adopt, it will
  apply to <i>flodu</i>, which equally comes at the end of a line, and the
  <i>u</i> of which may equally have been part of some following word which
  was never completed<a name="NtA252"
  href="#Nt252"><sup>[252]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Other linguistic data of the Franks casket would lead us to place it
  somewhere in the first half of the eighth century, and we should hardly
  expect to find <i>u</i> preserved as late as this<a name="NtA253"
  href="#Nt253"><sup>[253]</sup></a>. For we have seen that by 693 the
  <i>u</i> was already lost after a subordinate accent in the Essex
  charter. Yet it is arguable that the <i>u</i> was retained later after a
  long accented syllable (<i>fl<span class="over">ó</span>du</i>) than
  after a subordinate accent (<i>uu<span
  class="over">í</span>dmùndesfèlt</i>); and, besides, the casket is
  Northumbrian, and the sound changes need not have been simultaneous all
  over the country.</p>

  <p>We cannot but feel that the evidence is pitifully scanty. All we can
  say is that <i>perhaps</i> the <i>flodu</i> of the Franks casket shows
  that <i>u</i> was still preserved after a fully accented syllable as late
  as 700. But the <i>u</i> in <i>flodu</i> may be a deliberate archaism on
  the part of the writer, may be a local dialectal survival, may be a mere
  miswriting.</p>

  <p>B. The preservation of <i>h</i> between consonant and vowel.</p>

  <p>Here there is one clear example which we can date: the archaic
  spelling of the proper name <i>Welhisc</i>. <i>Signum manus uelhisci</i>
  occurs in a Kentish charter of 679<a name="NtA254"
  href="#Nt254"><sup>[254]</sup></a>. The same charter shows <i>h</i>
  already lost between vowels: <i>uuestan ae</i> (<i>ae</i> dative of
  <i>&#x113;a</i>, "river," cf. Gothic <i>ahwa</i>).</p>

  <p>Not much can be argued from the proper name <i>Welhisc</i>, as to the
  current pronunciation in Kent in 679, for an old man may well have
  continued to spell his name as it was spelt when he was a child, even
  though the current pronunciation had changed<a name="NtA255"
  href="#Nt255"><sup>[255]</sup></a>. But we have further evidence in the
  glosses, which show <i>h</i> sometimes preserved and sometimes not. These
  glosses are mechanical copies of an original which was presumably
  compiled between 680 and 720. We are therefore justified in arguing that
  at that date <i>h</i> was still preserved, at any rate occasionally.</p>

<p><!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"></a>{112}</span></p>

  <p>Of "Morsbach's test" we can then say that it establishes something of
  an argument that <i>Beowulf</i> was composed after the date when final
  <i>u</i> after a long syllable, or <i>h</i> between consonant and vowel,
  were lost, and that this date was probably within a generation or so of
  the year 700 <span class="scac">A.D.</span> But there are too many
  uncertain contingencies involved to make the test at all a conclusive
  one.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section III. Theories as to the structure of "Beowulf."</span></p>

  <p>Certain peculiarities in the structure of <i>Beowulf</i> can hardly
  fail to strike the reader. (1) The poem is not a biography of Beowulf,
  nor yet an episode in his life: it is two distinct episodes: the Grendel
  business and the dragon business, joined by a narrow bridge. (2) Both
  these stories are broken in upon by digressions: some of these concern
  Beowulf himself, so that we get a fairly complete idea of the life of our
  hero: but for the most part these digressions are not strictly apposite.
  (3) Even apart from these digressions, the narrative is often hampered:
  the poet begins his story, diverges and returns. (4) The traces of
  Christian thought and knowledge which meet us from time to time seem to
  belong to a different world from that of the Germanic life in which our
  poem has its roots.</p>

  <p>Now in the middle of the nineteenth century it was widely believed
  that the great epics of the world had been formed from collections of
  original shorter lays fitted together (often unskilfully) by later
  redactors. For a critic starting from this assumption, better material
  than the <i>Beowulf</i> could hardly be found. And it <i>was</i> with
  such assumptions that Carl Müllenhoff, the greatest of the scholars who
  have dissected the <i>Beowulf</i>, set to work. He attended the lectures
  of Lachmann, and formed, <!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page113"></a>{113}</span>a biographer tells us, the fixed resolve
  to do for one epic what his admired master had done for another<a
  name="NtA256" href="#Nt256"><sup>[256]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Müllenhoff claimed for his theories that they were simple<a
  name="NtA257" href="#Nt257"><sup>[257]</sup></a> and straightforward: and
  so they were, if we may be allowed to assume as a basis that the
  <i>Beowulf</i> is made up out of shorter lays, and that the only business
  of the critic is to define the scope of these lays. In the story of
  Beowulf's fight with Grendel (ll. 194-836: Müllenhoff's Sect. I) and with
  the dragon (ll. 2200-3183: Müllenhoff's Sect. IV) Müllenhoff saw the much
  interpolated remains of two original lays by different authors. But,
  before it was united to the dragon story, the Grendel story, Müllenhoff
  held, had already undergone many interpolations and additions. The story
  of Grendel's mother (ll. 837-1623: Sect. II) was added, Müllenhoff held,
  by one continuator as a sequel to the story of Grendel, and ll. 1-193
  were added by another hand as an introduction. Then this Grendel story
  was finally rounded off by an interpolator (A) who added the account of
  Beowulf's return home (Sect. III, ll. 1629-2199) and at the same time
  inserted passages into the poem throughout. Finally came Interpolator B,
  who was the first to combine the Grendel story, thus elaborated, with the
  dragon story. Interpolator B was responsible for the great bulk of the
  interpolations: episodes from other cycles and "theologizing" matter.</p>

  <p>Ten Brink, like Müllenhoff, regarded the poem as falling into four
  sections: the Grendel fight, the fight with Grendel's mother, the return
  home, the dragon fight. But Müllenhoff had imagined the epic composed out
  of one set of lays: incoherences, he thought, were due to the bungling of
  successive interpolators. Ten Brink assumed that in the case of all three
  fights, with Grendel, with Grendel's mother, and with the dragon, there
  had been two <i>parallel</i> versions, which a later redactor had
  combined together, and that it was to this combination that the frequent
  repetitions in the <!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page114"></a>{114}</span>narrative were due: he believed that not
  only were the different episodes of the poem originally distinct, but
  that each episode was compounded of two originally distinct lays,
  combined together.</p>

  <p>Now it cannot be denied that the process postulated by Müllenhoff
  <i>might</i> have taken place: a lay on Grendel and a lay on the
  dragon-fight might have been combined by some later compiler. Ten Brink's
  theory, too, is inherently not improbable: that there should have been
  two or more versions current of a popular story is probable enough: that
  a scribe should have tried to fit these two parallel versions together is
  not without precedent: very good examples of such attempts at harmonizing
  different versions can be got from an examination of the <span
  class="scac">MSS</span> of <i>Piers Plowman</i>.</p>

  <p>It is only here and there that we are struck by an inherent
  improbability in Müllenhoff's scheme. Thus the form in which Müllenhoff
  assumes the poem to have existed before Interpolator A set to work on it,
  is hardly a credible one. The "original poet" has brought Beowulf from
  his home to the Danish court, to slay Grendel, and the "continuator" has
  taken him to the haunted lake: Beowulf has plunged down, slain Grendel's
  mother, come back to land. Here Müllenhoff believed the poem to have
  ended, until "Interpolator A" came along, and told how Beowulf returned
  in triumph to Hrothgar, was thanked and rewarded, and then betook himself
  home, and was welcomed by Hygelac. That it would have been left to an
  interpolator to supply what from the old point of view was so necessary a
  part of the story as the return to Hrothgar is an assumption perilous
  indeed. "An epic poem only closes when everything is really concluded:
  not, like a modern novel, at a point where the reader can imagine the
  rest for himself<a name="NtA258" href="#Nt258"><sup>[258]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, however, the theories of the "dissecting school"
  are not in themselves faulty, if we admit the assumptions on which they
  rest. They fail however in two ways. An examination of the short lay and
  the long epic, so far as these are represented in extant documents, does
  not bear out <!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page115"></a>{115}</span>well the assumptions of the theorizers.
  Secondly, the minute scrutiny to which the poem has been subjected in
  matters of syntax, metre, dialect and tradition has failed to show any
  difference between the parts attributed to the different authors, such as
  we must certainly have expected to find, had the theories of the
  "dissecting school" been correct.</p>

  <p>That behind our extant <i>Beowulf</i>, and connecting it with the
  events of the sixth century, there must have been a number of older lays,
  may indeed well be admitted: also that to these lays our poem owes its
  plot, its traditions of metre and its phraseology, and perhaps (but this
  is a perilous assumption) continuous passages of its text. But what
  Müllenhoff and ten Brink go on to assume is that these original oral lays
  were simple in outline and treated a single well-defined episode in a
  straightforward manner; that later redactors and scribes corrupted this
  primitive simplicity; but that the modern critic, by demanding it, and
  using its presence or absence as a criterion, can still disentangle from
  the complex composite poem the simpler elements out of which it was built
  up.</p>

  <p>Here are rather large assumptions. What right have we to postulate
  that this primitive "literature without letters<a name="NtA259"
  href="#Nt259"><sup>[259]</sup></a>," these short oral ballads and lays,
  dealt with a single episode without digression or confusion: whilst the
  later age,&mdash;the civilized, Christianized age of written literature
  during which <i>Beowulf</i> in the form in which we now have it was
  produced,&mdash;is assumed to have been tolerant of both?</p>

  <p>No doubt, here and there, in different literatures, groups of short
  lays can be found which one can imagine might be combined into an orderly
  narrative poem, without much hacking about. But on the other hand a short
  lay will often tell, in less than a hundred lines, a story more complex
  than that of the <i>Iliad</i> or the <i>Odyssey</i>. Its shortness may be
  due, not to any limitation in the scope of the plot, but rather to the
  passionate haste with which it rushes through a long story. It is one
  thing to admit that there must have been short lays on the story of
  Beowulf: it is another to assume that these lays were of such a character
  that nothing was needed but compilers <!-- Page 116 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page116"></a>{116}</span>with a taste for
  arrangement and interpolation in order to turn them into the extant epic
  of <i>Beowulf</i>.</p>

  <p>When we find nearly five hundred lines spent in describing the
  reception of the hero in Hrothgar's land, we may well doubt whether this
  passage can have found its way into our poem through any such process of
  fitting together as Müllenhoff postulated. It would be out of scale in
  any narrative shorter than the <i>Beowulf</i> as we have it. It suggests
  to us that the epic is developed out of the lay, not by a process of
  fitting together, but rather by a retelling of the story in a more
  leisurely way.</p>

  <p>A comparison of extant short lays or ballads with extant epics has
  shown that, if these epics were made by stringing lays together, such
  lays must have been different from the great majority of the short lays
  now known. "The lays into which this theory dissects the epics, or which
  it assumes as the sources of the epics, differ in two ways from extant
  lays: they deal with short, incomplete subjects and they have an epic
  breadth of style<a name="NtA260" href="#Nt260"><sup>[260]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p>It has been shown by W. P. Ker<a name="NtA261"
  href="#Nt261"><sup>[261]</sup></a> that a comparison of such fragments as
  have survived of the Germanic short lay (<i>Finnsburg</i>,
  <i>Hildebrand</i>) does not bear out the theory that the epic is a
  conglomeration of such lays. "It is the change and development in style
  rather than any increase in the complexity of the themes that accounts
  for the difference in scale between the shorter and the longer
  poems."</p>

  <p>A similar conclusion is reached by Professor Hart: "It might be
  illuminating to base a <i>Liedertheorie</i> in part, at least, upon a
  study of existing <i>Lieder</i>, rather than wholly upon an attempt to
  dismember the epic in question. Such study reveals indeed a certain
  similarity in kind of Ballad and Epic, but it reveals at the same time an
  enormous difference in degree, in stage of development. If the
  <i>Beowulf</i>, then, was made up of a series of heroic songs, strung
  together with little or no modification, these songs must have been
  something very different from the popular ballad<a name="NtA262"
  href="#Nt262"><sup>[262]</sup></a>."</p>

<p><!-- Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>{117}</span></p>

  <p>And subsequent investigations into the history and folk-lore of our
  poem have not confirmed Müllenhoff's theory: in some cases indeed they
  have hit it very hard. When a new light was thrown upon the story by the
  discovery of the parallels between <i>Beowulf</i> and the <i>Grettis
  saga</i>, it became clear that passages which Müllenhoff had condemned as
  otiose interpolations were likely to be genuine elements in the tale. Dr
  Olrik's minute investigations into the history of the Danish kings have
  shown from yet another point of view how allusions, which were rashly
  condemned by Müllenhoff and ten Brink as idle amplifications, are, in
  fact, essential.</p>

  <p>How the investigation of the metre, form, and syntax of <i>Beowulf</i>
  has disclosed an archaic strictness of usage has been explained above
  (Sect. II). This usage is in striking contrast with the practice of later
  poets like Cynewulf. How far we are justified in relying upon such
  differences of usage as criteria of <i>exact</i> date is open to dispute.
  But it seems clear that, had Müllenhoff's theories been accurate, we
  might reasonably have expected to have been able to differentiate between
  the earlier and the later strata in so composite a poem.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The composite theory has lately been strongly supported by Schücking<a
  name="NtA263" href="#Nt263"><sup>[263]</sup></a>. Schücking starts from
  the fact, upon which we are all agreed, that the poem falls into two main
  divisions: the story of how Beowulf at Heorot slew Grendel and Grendel's
  mother, and the story of the dragon, which fifty years later he slew at
  his home. These are connected by the section which tells how Beowulf
  returned from Heorot to his own home and was honourably received by his
  king, Hygelac.</p>

  <p>It is now admitted that the ways of Old English narrative were not
  necessarily our ways, and that we must not postulate, because our poem
  falls into two somewhat clumsily connected sections, that therefore it is
  compounded out of two originally distinct lays. But, on the other hand,
  as Schücking rightly urges, instances <i>are</i> forthcoming of two O.E.
  poems having been clumsily connected into one<a name="NtA264"
  href="#Nt264"><sup>[264]</sup></a>. Therefore, whilst no one would now
  urge that <i>Beowulf</i> is put together out of two older <!-- Page 118
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"></a>{118}</span>lays,
  <i>merely</i> because it can so easily be divided into two sections, this
  fact does suggest that a case exists for examination.</p>

  <p>Now if a later poet had connected together two old lays, one on the
  Grendel and Grendel's mother business, and one on the dragon business, we
  might fairly expect that this connecting link would show traces of a
  different style. It is accordingly on the connecting link, the story of
  <i>Beowulf's Return</i> and reception by Hygelac, that Schücking
  concentrates his attention, submitting it to the most elaborate tests to
  see if it betrays metrical, stylistic or syntactical divergencies from
  the rest of the poem.</p>

  <p>Various tests are applied, which admittedly give no result, such as
  the frequency of the repetition in the <i>Return</i> of half verse
  formulas which occur elsewhere in <i>Beowulf</i><a name="NtA265"
  href="#Nt265"><sup>[265]</sup></a>, or the way in which compound nouns
  fit into the metrical scheme<a name="NtA266"
  href="#Nt266"><sup>[266]</sup></a>. Metrical criteria are very little
  more helpful<a name="NtA267" href="#Nt267"><sup>[267]</sup></a>. We have
  seen that the antiquity of <i>Beowulf</i> is proved by the cases where
  metre demands the substitution of an older uncontracted form for the
  existing shorter one. Schücking argues that no instance occurs in the 267
  lines of the <i>Return</i>. But, even if this were the case, it might
  well be mere accident, since examples only occur at rare intervals
  anywhere in <i>Beowulf</i>. As a matter of fact, however, examples are to
  be found in the <i>Return</i><a name="NtA268"
  href="#Nt268"><sup>[268]</sup></a> (quite up to the normal proportion),
  though two of the clearest come in a portion of it which Schücking rather
  arbitrarily excludes.</p>

  <p>Coming to syntax in its broadest sense, and especially the method of
  constructing and connecting sentences, Schücking enumerates several
  constructions which are found in the <i>Return</i>, but not elsewhere in
  <i>Beowulf</i>. Syntax is a subject to which he has given special study,
  and his opinion upon it must be of value. But I doubt whether anyone as
  expert in the subject as Schücking could not find in every passage of
  like length in <i>Beowulf</i> some constructions not to be exactly
  paralleled elsewhere in the poem.</p>

<p><!-- Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"></a>{119}</span></p>

  <p>The fact that we find here, and here only, passages introduced by the
  clauses <i>ic sceal forð sprecan</i><a name="NtA269"
  href="#Nt269"><sup>[269]</sup></a>, and <i>t&#x14D; lang ys t&#x14D;
  reccenne</i><a name="NtA270" href="#Nt270"><sup>[270]</sup></a>, is
  natural when we realize that we have here the longest speech in the whole
  poem, which obviously calls for such apologies for prolixity.</p>

  <p>The fact that no parentheses occur in the <i>Return</i> does not
  differentiate it from the rest of <i>Beowulf</i>: for, as Schücking
  himself points out elsewhere, there are three other passages in the poem,
  longer than the <i>Return</i>, which are equally devoid of parentheses<a
  name="NtA271" href="#Nt271"><sup>[271]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>There remain a few <i>hapax legomena</i><a name="NtA272"
  href="#Nt272"><sup>[272]</sup></a>, but very inconclusive.</p>

  <p>There are, in addition, examples which occur only in the
  <i>Return</i>, and in certain other episodic passages. These episodic
  passages also, Schücking supposes, may have been added by the same
  reviser who added the <i>Return</i>. But this is a perilous change of
  position. For example, a certain peculiarity is found only in the
  <i>Return</i> and the introductory genealogical section<a name="NtA273"
  href="#Nt273"><sup>[273]</sup></a>; or in the <i>Return</i> and the
  <i>Finn Episode</i><a name="NtA274" href="#Nt274"><sup>[274]</sup></a>.
  But when Schücking proceeds to the suggestion that the
  <i>Introduction</i> or the <i>Finn Episode</i> may have been added by the
  same reviser who added <i>Beowulf's Return</i>, he knocks the bottom out
  of some of his previous arguments. The argument from the absence of
  parentheses (whatever it was worth) must go: for according to Schücking's
  own punctuation, such parentheses are found both in the
  <i>Introduction</i> and in the <i>Finn Episode</i>. If these are by the
  author of the <i>Return</i>, then doubt is thrown upon one of the alleged
  peculiarities of that author; we find the author of the <i>Return</i> no
  more averse <i>on the whole</i> to parentheses than the author or authors
  of the rest of the poem.</p>

  <p>Peculiar usages of the moods and tenses are found twice in the
  <i>Return</i><a name="NtA275" href="#Nt275"><sup>[275]</sup></a>, and
  once again in the episode where Beowulf <!-- Page 120 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page120"></a>{120}</span>recalls his youth<a
  name="NtA276" href="#Nt276"><sup>[276]</sup></a>. Supposing this episode
  to be also the work of the author of the <i>Return</i>, we get peculiar
  constructions used three times by this author, which cannot be paralleled
  elsewhere in <i>Beowulf</i><a name="NtA277"
  href="#Nt277"><sup>[277]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Now a large number of instances like this last might afford basis for
  argument; but they must be in bulk in order to prove anything. By the
  laws of chance we might expect, in any passage of three hundred lines,
  taken at random anywhere in <i>Beowulf</i>, to find something which
  occurred only in one other passage elsewhere in the poem. We cannot
  forthwith declare the two passages to be the work of an interpolator. One
  swallow does not make a summer.</p>

  <p>And the arguments as to style are not helped by arguments as to
  matter. Even if it be granted&mdash;which I do not grant&mdash;that the
  long repetition narrating Beowulf's contest with Grendel and Grendel's
  mother is tedious, there is no reason why this tedious repetition should
  not as well be the work of the original poet as of a later reviser. Must
  we find many different authors for <i>The Ring and the Book</i>? It must
  be granted that there are details (such as the mention of Grendel's
  glove) found in the Grendel struggle as narrated in <i>Beowulf's
  Return</i>, but not found in the original account of the struggle.
  Obviously the object is to avoid monotony, by introducing a new feature:
  but this might as well have been aimed at by the old poet retelling the
  tale as by a new poet retelling it.</p>

  <p>To me, the fact that so careful and elaborate a study of the story of
  <i>Beowulf's Return</i> fails to betray any satisfactory evidence of
  separate authorship, is a confirmation of the verdict of "not proven"
  against the "dividers<a name="NtA278"
  href="#Nt278"><sup>[278]</sup></a>." But there can be no doubt that
  Schücking's method, his attempt to prove differences in treatment,
  grammar, and style, is the right one. If any satisfactory results are to
  be attained, it must be in this way.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section IV. Are the Christian elements incompatible with the rest of the poem?</span></p>

  <p>Later students (like the man in Dante, placed between two equally
  enticing dishes) have been unable to decide in favour of either of the
  rival theories of Müllenhoff and ten Brink, and consequently the unity of
  the poem, which always had its champions, has of late years come to be
  maintained with increasing conviction and certainty.</p>

  <p>Yet many recent critics have followed Müllenhoff so far at least as to
  believe that the Christian passages are inconsistent with what they
  regard as the "essentially heathen" tone of the rest of the poem, and are
  therefore the work of an interpolator<a name="NtA279"
  href="#Nt279"><sup>[279]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Certainly no one can escape a feeling of incongruity, as he passes
  from ideas of which the home lies in the forests of ancient Germany, to
  others which come from the Holy Land. But that both sets of ideas could
  not have been cherished, in England, about the year 700, by one and the
  same poet, is an assumption which calls for examination.</p>

  <p>As Christianity swept northward, situations were created which to the
  modern student are incongruous. But the Teutonic chief often had a larger
  mind than the modern student: he needed to have, if he was to get the
  best at the same time both from his wild fighting men and from his Latin
  clerks. It is this which gives so remarkable a character to the great men
  of the early centuries of converted Teutonism: men, like Theodoric the
  Great or Charles the Great, who could perform simultaneously the duties
  of a Germanic king and of a Roman Emperor: kings like Alfred the Great or
  St Olaf, who combined the character of the tough fighting chieftain with
  that of the saintly churchman. I love to think of these incongruities: to
  remember that the warrior Alfred, surrounded by <i>thegn</i> and
  <i>gesith</i>, listening to the "Saxon songs" which he loved, was yet the
  same Alfred who painfully translated Gregory's <i>Pastoral <!-- Page 122
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>{122}</span>Care</i> under
  the direction of foreign clerics. It is well to remember that Charles the
  Great, the catholic and the orthodox, collected ancient lays which his
  successors thought too heathen to be tolerated; or that St Olaf (who was
  so holy that, having absent mindedly chipped shavings off a stick on
  Sunday, he burnt them, as penance, on his open hand) nevertheless allowed
  to be sung before him, on the morning of his last fight, one of the most
  wild and utterly heathen of all the old songs&mdash;the
  <i>Bjarkamál</i>.</p>

  <p>It has been claimed that the account of the funeral rites of Beowulf
  is such as "no Christian poet could or would have composed<a
  name="NtA280" href="#Nt280"><sup>[280]</sup></a>." Lately this argument
  has been stated more at length:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In the long account of Beowulf's obsequies&mdash;beginning with the
  dying king's injunction to construct for him a lofty barrow on the edge
  of the cliff, and ending with the scene of the twelve princes riding
  round the barrow, proclaiming the dead man's exploits&mdash;we have the
  most detailed description of an early Teutonic funeral which has come
  down to us, and one of which the accuracy is confirmed in every point by
  archaeological or contemporary literary evidence<a name="NtA281"
  href="#Nt281"><sup>[281]</sup></a>. Such an account must have been
  composed within living memory of a time when ceremonies of this kind were
  still actually in use<a name="NtA282"
  href="#Nt282"><sup>[282]</sup></a>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Owing to the standing of the scholar who urges it, this argument is
  coming to rank as a dogma<a name="NtA283"
  href="#Nt283"><sup>[283]</sup></a>, and needs therefore rather close
  examination.</p>

  <p>Professor Chadwick <i>may</i> be right in urging that the custom of
  burning the dead had gone out of use in England even before Christianity
  was introduced<a name="NtA284" href="#Nt284"><sup>[284]</sup></a>: anyhow
  it is certain that, wherever it survived, the practice was disapproved by
  ecclesiastics, and was, indeed, formally censured and suppressed by the
  church abroad.</p>

  <p>The church equally censured and endeavoured to suppress the ancient
  "heathen lays"; but without equal success. Now, in many of these lays the
  heathen rites of cremation must certainly have been depicted, and, in
  this way, the memory of the old funeral customs must have been kept
  fresh, long <!-- Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page123"></a>{123}</span>after the last funeral pyre had died out
  in England. Of course there were then, as there have been ever since,
  puritanical people who objected that heathen lays and heathen ways were
  no fit concern for a Christian man. But the protests of such purists are
  just the strongest evidence that the average Christian did continue to
  take an interest in these things. We have seen that the very monks of
  Lindisfarne had to be warned by Alcuin. I cannot see that there is any
  such <i>a priori</i> impossibility that a poet, though a sincere
  Christian enough, would have described a funeral in the old style,
  modelling his account upon older lays, or upon tradition derived from
  those lays.</p>

  <p>The church might disapprove of the practice of cremation, but we have
  no reason to suppose that mention of it was tabooed. And many of the old
  burial customs seem to have kept their hold, even upon the converted.
  Indeed, when the funeral of Attila is instanced as a type of the old
  heathen ceremony, it seems to be forgotten that those Gothic chieftains
  who rode their horses round the body of Attila were themselves probably
  Arian Christians, and that the historian who has preserved the account
  was an orthodox cleric.</p>

  <p>Saxo Grammaticus, ecclesiastic as he was, has left us several
  accounts<a name="NtA285" href="#Nt285"><sup>[285]</sup></a> of
  cremations. He mentions the "pyre built of ships" and differs from the
  poet of <i>Beowulf</i> chiefly because he allows those frankly heathen
  references to gods and offerings which the poet of <i>Beowulf</i>
  excludes. Of course, Saxo was merely translating. One can quite believe
  that a Christian poet composing an account of a funeral in the old days,
  would have omitted the more frankly heathen features, as indeed the
  <i>Beowulf</i> poet does. But Saxo shows us how far into Christian times
  the ancient funeral, in all its heathendom, was remembered; and how
  little compunction an ecclesiastic had in recording it. The assumption
  that no Christian poet would have composed the account of Beowulf's
  funeral or of Scyld's funeral ship, seems then to be quite
  unjustified.</p>

  <p>The further question remains: Granting that he <i>would</i>, could he?
  Is the account of Beowulf's funeral so true to old custom that it must
  have been composed by an eye-witness of <!-- Page 124 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page124"></a>{124}</span>the rite of cremation?
  Is its "accuracy confirmed in every point by archaeological or
  contemporary literary evidence"?</p>

  <p>As to the archaeological evidence, the fact seems to be that the
  account is archaeologically so inexact that it has given great trouble to
  one eminent antiquary, Knut Stjerna. That the pyre should be hung with
  arms, which are <i>burnt</i> with the hero (ll. 3139-40), and that then a
  second supply of unburnt treasures should be <i>buried</i> with the
  cremated bones (ll. 3163-8), is regarded by Stjerna as extraordinary<a
  name="NtA286" href="#Nt286"><sup>[286]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Surely, any such inexactitude is what we should expect in a late poet,
  drawing upon tradition. He would know that in heathen times bodies were
  burnt, and that weapons were buried; and he might well combine both. It
  is not necessary to suppose, as Stjerna does, that the poet has combined
  two separate accounts of Beowulf's funeral, given in older lays, in one
  of which the hero was burnt, and in the other buried. But the fact that
  an archaeological specialist finds the account of Beowulf's funeral so
  inexact that he has to assume a confused and composite source, surely
  disposes of the argument that it is so exact that it must date back to
  heathen times.</p>

  <p>As to confirmation from literary documents, the only one instanced by
  Chadwick is the account of the funeral of Attila. The parallel here is by
  no means so close as has been asserted. The features of Attila's funeral
  are: the lying in state, during which the chosen horsemen of the nation
  rode round the body singing the dead king's praises; the funeral feast;
  and the burial (not burning) of the body. Now the only feature which
  recurs in <i>Beowulf</i> is the praise of the dead man by the mounted
  thanes. Even here there is an essential difference. Attila's men rode
  round the dead body of their lord <i>before</i> his funeral. Beowulf's
  retainers ride and utter their lament around (not the body but) the grave
  mound of their lord, ten days after the cremation.</p>

  <p>And this is perhaps no accidental discrepancy: it may well correspond
  to a real difference in practice between the Gothic custom of the time of
  the migrations and the Anglo-Saxon <!-- Page 125 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page125"></a>{125}</span>practice as it
  prevailed in Christian times<a name="NtA287"
  href="#Nt287"><sup>[287]</sup></a>. For many documents, including the
  <i>Dream of the Rood</i>, tend to show that the <i>sorhl&#x113;oð</i>,
  the lament of the retainers for their dead lord, survived into Christian
  times, but as a ceremony which was subsequent not merely to the funeral,
  but even to the building of the tomb.</p>

  <p>So that, here again, so far from the archaeological accuracy of the
  account of Beowulf's funeral being confirmed by the account of that of
  Attila, we find a discrepancy such as we might expect if a Christian
  poet, in later times, had tried to describe a funeral of the old heathen
  type.</p>

  <p>Of course, the evidence is far too scanty to allow of much positive
  argument. Still, <i>so far as it goes</i>, and that is not far, it rather
  tends to show that the account of the funeral customs is not quite
  accurate, representing what later Christian times knew by tradition of
  the rite of cremation, rather than showing the observation of that rite
  by an eye-witness.</p>

  <p>We must turn, then, to some other argument, if we wish to prove that
  the Christian element is inconsistent with other parts of the poem.</p>

  <p>A second argument that <i>Beowulf</i> must belong either to heathen
  times, or to the very earliest Christian period in England, has been
  found in the character of the Christian allusions: they contain no
  "reference to Christ, to the Cross, to the Virgin or the Saints, to any
  doctrine of the church in regard to the Trinity, the Atonement,
  <i>etc.</i><a name="NtA288" href="#Nt288"><sup>[288]</sup></a>" "A pious
  Jew would have no difficulty in assenting to them all<a name="NtA289"
  href="#Nt289"><sup>[289]</sup></a>." Hence it has been argued<a
  name="NtA290" href="#Nt290"><sup>[290]</sup></a> that they are the work
  of an interpolator who, working upon a poem "essentially heathen," was
  not able to impose upon it more than this "vague and colourless
  Christianity." I cannot see this. If passages had to be rewritten at all,
  it was just as easy to rewrite them in a tone emphatically Christian as
  in a tone mildly so. The difficulties which the interpolator would meet
  in removing a heathen phrase, and composing a Christian half-line in
  substitution, would be metrical, rather than theological. For example, in
  a second <!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page126"></a>{126}</span>half-line the interpolator could have
  written <i>ond h&#x101;lig Crist</i> or <i>ylda nergend</i> just as
  easily as <i>ond h&#x101;lig god</i>, or <i>ylda waldend</i>: he could
  have put in an allusion to the Trinity or to the Cross as easily as to
  the Lord of Hosts or the King of Glory. It would depend upon the
  alliteration which was the more convenient. And surely, if he was a monk
  deliberately sitting down to turn a heathen into a Christian poem, he
  would, of two alternatives, have favoured the more dogmatically
  Christian.</p>

  <p>The vagueness which is so characteristic of the Christian references
  in <i>Beowulf</i> can then hardly be due to the poem having originally
  been a heathen one, worked over by a Christian.</p>

  <p>Others have seen in this vagueness a proof "that the minstrels who
  introduced the Christian element had but a vague knowledge of the new
  faith<a name="NtA291" href="#Nt291"><sup>[291]</sup></a>": or that the
  poem was the work of "a man who, without having, or wanting to have, much
  definite instruction, had become Christian because the Court had newly
  become Christian<a name="NtA292" href="#Nt292"><sup>[292]</sup></a>."
  But, vague as it is, does the Christianity of <i>Beowulf</i> justify such
  a judgment as this? Do not the characters of Hrothgar or of Beowulf, of
  Hygd or of Wealhtheow, show a Christian influence which, however little
  dogmatic, is anything but superficial? This is a matter where individual
  feeling rather than argument must weigh: but the <i>Beowulf</i> does not
  seem to me the work of a man whose adherence to Christianity is merely
  nominal<a name="NtA293" href="#Nt293"><sup>[293]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>And, so far as the absence of dogma goes, it seems to have been
  overlooked that the Christian references in the <i>Battle of Maldon</i>,
  written when England had been Christian for over three centuries, are
  precisely of the same vague character as those in <i>Beowulf</i>.</p>

  <p>Surely the explanation is that to a devout, but not <!-- Page 127
  --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page127"></a>{127}</span>theologically-minded poet, writing battle
  poetry, references to God as the Lord of Hosts or the Giver of Victory
  came naturally&mdash;references to the Trinity or the Atonement did not.
  This seems quite a sufficient explanation; though it may be that in
  <i>Beowulf</i> the poet has consciously avoided dogmatic references,
  because he realized that the characters in his story were not
  Christians<a name="NtA294" href="#Nt294"><sup>[294]</sup></a>. That, at
  the same time, he allows those characters with whom he sympathizes to
  speak in a Christian spirit is only what we should expect. Just so
  Chaucer allows his pagans&mdash;Theseus for instance&mdash;to use
  Christian expressions about God or the soul, whilst avoiding anything
  strikingly doctrinal.</p>

  <p>Finally I cannot admit that the Christian passages are "poetically of
  no value<a name="NtA295" href="#Nt295"><sup>[295]</sup></a>." The
  description of Grendel nearing Heorot is good:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Ð&#x101; c&#x14D;m of m&#x14D;re under mist-hleoþum</p>
      <p>Grendel gongan&mdash;</p>
    </div>

  <p>but it is heightened when the poet adds:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Godes yrre bær.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Yet here again it is impossible to argue: it is a matter of individual
  feeling.</p>

  <p>When, however, we come to the further statement of Dr Bradley, that
  the Christian passages are not only interpolations poetically worthless,
  but "may be of any date down to that of the extant <span
  class="scac">MS</span>" (i.e. about the year 1000 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>), we have reached ground where argument
  <i>is</i> possible, and where definite results can be attained. For Dr
  Bradley, at the same time that he makes this statement about the
  character of the Christian passages, also quotes the archaic syntax of
  <i>Beowulf</i> as proving an early date<a name="NtA296"
  href="#Nt296"><sup>[296]</sup></a>. <i>But this archaic syntax is just as
  prominent a feature of the Christian passages as of any other parts of
  the poem.</i> If these Christian passages are really the work of a
  "monkish copyist, whose piety exceeded his poetic powers<a name="NtA297"
  href="#Nt297"><sup>[297]</sup></a>," how do they come to show an antique
  syntax and a strict technique surpassing those of Cynewulf or the
  <i>Dream <!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page128"></a>{128}</span>of the Rood</i>? Why do they not betray
  their origin by metrical inaccuracies such as we find in poems
  undoubtedly interpolated, like <i>Widsith</i> or the <i>Seafarer</i>?</p>

  <p>Dr Bradley is "our chief English seer in these matters," as Dr
  Furnivall said long ago; and it is only with the greatest circumspection
  that one should differ from any of his conclusions. Nevertheless, I feel
  that, before we can regard any portion of <i>Beowulf</i> as later than
  the rest, discrepancies need to be demonstrated.</p>

  <p>Until such discrepancies between the different parts of <i>Beowulf</i>
  can be demonstrated, we are justified in regarding the poem as
  homogeneous: as a production of the Germanic world enlightened by the new
  faith. Whether through external violence or internal decay, this world
  was fated to rapid change, and perished with its promise unfulfilled. The
  great merit of <i>Beowulf</i> as a historic document is that it shows us
  a picture of a period in which the virtues of the heathen "Heroic Age"
  were tempered by the gentleness of the new belief; an age warlike, yet
  Christian: devout, yet tolerant.</p>

  <p>Uerum a Dan, ut fert antiquitas, regum nostrorum stemmata, ceu quodam

  <p>Lecturi regem ueteres affixis humo saxis insistere, suffragiaque

  creatus, sequentis fortunæ malignitate, ex rege priuatus euasit. Bello
  siquidem a Lothero captus, regni depositione spiritum mercatus est; hæc
  sola quippe uicto salutis conditio reddebatur. Ita fraternis iniuriis
  imperium abdicare coactus, documentum hominibus præbuit, ut plus
  splendoris, ita minus securitatis, aulis quam tuguriis inesse. Ceterum
  iniuriæ tam patiens fuit, ut honoris damno tanquam beneficio gratulari
  crederetur, sagaciter, ut puto, regiæ conditionis habitum contemplatus.
  Sed nec Lotherus tolerabiliorem regem quam militem egit, ut prorsus
  insolentia ac scelere regnum auspicari uideretur; siquidem illustrissimum
  quemque uita aut opibus spoliare, patriamque bonis ciuibus uacuefacere
  probitatis loco duxit, regni æmulos ratus, quos nobilitate pares
  habuerat. Nec diu scelerum impunitus, patriæ consternatione perimitur;

  ita auitis uirtutibus feliciter respondit, remotiorem pariter ac
  præstantiorem hereditarii moris portionem amplexus. Huius adolescentia
  inter paternos uenatores immanis beluæ subactione insignis extitit,
  mirandoque rei euentu futuræ eius fortitudinis habitum ominata est. Nam
  cum a tutoribus forte, quorum summo studio educabatur, inspectandæ
  uenationis licentiam impetrasset, obuium sibi insolitæ granditatis ursum,
  telo uacuus, cingulo, cuius usum habebat, religandum curauit, necandumque
  comitibus præbuit. Sed et complures spectatæ fortitudinis pugiles per
  idem tempus uiritim ab eo superati produntur, e quibus Attalus et Scatus
  clari illustresque fuere. Quindecim annos natus, inusitato corporis
  incremento perfectissimum humani roboris specimen præferebat, tantaque
  indolis eius experimenta fuere, ut ab ipso ceteri Danorum reges communi

  <p>Saxo then relates the adventures of Gram, Hadingus and Frotho, whom he
  represents as respectively son, grandson and great-grandson of Skioldus.
  That Gram and Hadingus are interpolated in the family is shewn by the
  fact that the pedigree of Sweyn Aageson passes direct from Skiold to his
  son Frothi.</p>

  <p>Per idem tempus Agnerus quidam, Ingelli films, sororem Roluonis, Rutam
  nomine, matrimonio ducturus, ingenti conuiuio nuptias instruit. In quo
  cum pugiles, omni petulantiæ genere debacchantes, in Ialtonem quendam
  nodosa passim ossa coniicerent, accidit, ut eius consessor, Biarco
  nomine, iacientis errore uehementem capite ictum exciperet. Qui dolore
  pariter ac ludibrio lacessitus, osse inuicem in iacientem remisso,
  frontem eius in occuput reflexit, idemque loco frontis intorsit,
  transuersum hominis animum uultus obliquitate mulctando. Ea res
  contumeliosam ioci insolentiam temperauit, pugilesque regia abire coegit.
  Qua conuiuii iniuria permotus, sponsus ferro cum Biarcone decernere
  statuit, uiolatæ hilaritatis ultionem duelii nomine quæsiturus. In cuius
  ingressu, utri prior feriendi copia deberetur diutule certatum est. Non
  enim antiquitus in edendis agonibus crebræ ictuum uicissitudines
  petebantur: sed erat cum interuallo temporis etiam feriendi distincta
  successio; rarisque sed atrocibus plagis certamina gerebantur, ut gloria
  potius percussionum magnitudini, quam numero deferretur. Prælato ob
  generis dignitatem Agnero, tanta ui ictum ab eo editum <!-- Page 133
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page133"></a>{133}</span>constat, ut,
  prima cassidis parte conscissa, supremam capitis cuticulam uulneraret,
  ferrumque mediis galeæ interclusum foraminibus dimitteret. Tunc Biarco
  mutuo percussurus, quo plenius ferrum libraret, pedem trunco annixus,
  medium Agneri corpus præstantis acuminis mucrone transegit. Sunt qui
  asserant, morientem Agnerum soluto in risum ore per summam doloris
  dissimulationem spiritum reddidisse. Cuius ultionem pugiles auidius
  expetentes, simili per Biarconem exitio mulctati sunt. Utebatur quippe
  præstantis acuminis inusitatæque longitudinis gladio, quem Løui uocabat.
  Talibus operum meritis exultanti nouam de se siluestris fera uictoriam
  præbuit. Ursum quippe eximiæ magnitudinis obuium sibi inter dumeta factum
  iaculo confecit: comitemque suum Ialtonem, quo uiribus maior euaderet,
  applicato ore egestum belluæ cruorem haurire iussit. Creditum namque
  erat, hoc potionis genere corporei roboris incrementa præstari. His
  facinorum uirtutibus clarissimas optimatum familiaritates adeptus, etiam
  regi percarus euasit; sororem eius Rutam uxorem asciuit, uictique sponsam
  uictoriæ præmium habuit. Ab Atislo lacessiti Roluonis ultionem armis
  exegit, eumque uictum hello prostrauit. Tunc Roluo magni acuminis iuuenem
  Hiarthwarum nomine, sorore Sculda sibi in matrimonium data, annuoque
  uectigali imposito, Suetiæ præfectum constituit, libertatis iacturam
  affinitatis beneficio leniturus.</p>

  <p>Hoc loci quiddam memoratu iucundum operi inseratur. Adolescens quidam
  Wiggo nomine, corpoream Roluonis magnitudinem attentiori contemplatione
  scrutatus, ingentique eiusdem admiratione captus, percontari per
  ludibrium c&oelig;pit, quisnam esset iste Krage, quem tanto staturæ
  fastigio prodiga rerum natura ditasset; faceto cauillationis genere
  inusitatum proceritatis habitum prosecutus. Dicitur enim lingua Danica
  'krage' truncus, cuius semicæsis ramis fastigia conscenduntur, ita ut
  pes, præcisorum stipitum obsequio perinde ac scalæ beneficio nixus,
  sensimque ad superiora prouectus, petitæ celsitudinis compendium
  assequatur. Quern uocis iactum Roluo perinde ac inclytum sibi cognomen
  amplexus, urbanitatem dicti ingentis armillæ dono prosequitur. Qua Wiggo
  dexteram excultam extollens, læua per pudoris simulationem post tergum
  <!-- Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page134"></a>{134}</span>reflexa, ridiculum corporis incessum
  præbuit, præfatus, exiguo lætari munere, quem sors diutinæ tenuisset
  inopiæ. Rogatus, cur ita se gereret, inopem ornamenti manum nulloque
  cultus beneficio gloriantem ad aspectum reliquæ uerecundo paupertatis
  rubore perfundi dicebat. Cuius dicti calliditate consentaneum priori
  munus obtinuit. Siquidem Roluo manum, quæ ab ipso occultabatur, exemplo
  reliquæ in medium accersendam curauit. Nec Wiggoni rependendi beneficii
  cura defuit. Siquidem arctissima uoti nuncupatione pollicitus est, si
  Roluonem ferro perire contingeret, ultionem se ab eius interfectoribus
  exacturum. Nec prætereundum, quod olim ingressuri curiam proceres
  famulatus sui principia alicuius magnæ rei uoto principibus obligare
  solebant, uirtute tirocinium auspicantes.</p>

  <p>Interea Sculda, tributariæ solutionis pudore permota, diris animum
  commentis applicans, maritum, exprobrata condicionis deformitate,
  propulsandæ seruitutis monitu concitatum atque ad insidias Roluoni
  nectendas perductum atrocissimis nouarum rerum consiliis imbuit, plus
  unumquenque libertati quam necessitudini debere testata. Igitur crebras
  armorum massas, diuersi generis tegminibus obuolutas, tributi more per
  Hiarthwarum in Daniam perferri iubet, occidendi noctu regis materiam
  præbituras. Refertis itaque falsa uectigalium mole nauigiis, Lethram
  pergitur, quod oppidum, a Roluone constructum eximiisque regni opibus
  illustratum, ceteris confinium prouinciarum urbibus regiæ fundationis et
  sedis auctoritate præstabat. Rex aduentum Hiarthwari conuiualis impensæ
  deliciis prosecutus ingenti se potione proluerat, hospitibus præter morem
  ebrietatis intemperantiam formidantibus. Ceteris igitur altiorem
  carpentibus somnum, Sueones, quibus scelesti libido propositi communem
  quietis usum ademerat, cubiculis furtim delabi c&oelig;pere. Aperitur
  ilico telorum occlusa congeries, et sua sibi quisque tacitus arma
  connectit. Deinde regiam petunt, irruptisque penetralibus in dormientium
  corpora ferrum destringunt. Experrecti complures, quibus non minus subitæ
  cladis horror quam somni stupor incesserat, dubio nisu discrimini
  restitere, socii an hostes occurrerent, noctis errore incertum reddente.
  Eiusdem forte silentio noctis Hialto, qui <!-- Page 135 --><span

  spectatæ probitatis merito præeminebat, rus egressus, scorti se
  complexibus dederat. Hic cum obortum pugnæ fragorem stupida procul aure
  sensisset, fortitudinem luxuriæ prætulit, maluitque funestum Martis
  discrimen appetere, quam blandis Veneris illecebris indulgere. Quanta
  hunc militem regis caritate flagrasse putemus, qui, cum ignorantiæ
  simulatione excusationem absentiæ præstare posset, salutem suam manifesto
  periculo obicere, quam uoluptati seruare satius existimauit? Discedentem

  reddidit, erubescendoque uulnere libidinosæ percunctationis dictum
  mulctauit, mentis lasciuiam oris iactura temperandam existimans. Quo
  facto, liberum quæsitæ rei iudicium a se ei relinqui dixit. Post hæc,
  repetito ocius oppido, confertissimis se globis immergit, aduersasque

<p class="cenhead">(ed. Finnur Jónsson, København, 1904, p. 65 ff.)</p>

  <p>Síðan fór B&#x1EB;ðvarr leið sína til Hleiðargarðs. Hann kemr til
  konungs atsetu. B&#x1EB;ðvarr leiðir síðan hest sinn á stall hjá konungs
  hestum hinum beztu ok spyrr engan at; gekk síðan inn í h&#x1EB;llina, ok
  var þar fátt manna. Hann sez utarliga, ok sem hann hefir verit þar litla
  hríð, heyrir hann þrausk n&#x1EB;kkut utar í hornit í einhverjum stað.
  B&#x1EB;ðvarr lítr þangat ok sér, at mannsh&#x1EB;nd kemr upp úr mikilli
  beinahrúgu, er þar lá; h&#x1EB;ndin var sv&#x1EB;rt mj&#x1EB;k.
  B&#x1EB;ðvarr gengr þangat til ok spyrr, hverr þar væri í beinahrúgunni;
  þá var honum svarat ok heldr óframliga: "H&#x1EB;ttr heiti ek, Bokki
  sæll." "Hví ertu hér, segir B&#x1EB;ðvarr, eða hvat gerir þú?"
  H&#x1EB;ttr segir: "ek geri mér skjaldborg, Bokki sæll." B&#x1EB;ðvarr
  sagði: "vesall ertu þinnar skjaldborgar." B&#x1EB;ðvarr þrífr til hans ok
  hnykkir honum upp úr beinahrúgunni. H&#x1EB;ttr kvað þá hátt við ok
  mælti: "nú viltu mér bana, ger eigi þetta, svá sem ek hefi nú vel um búiz
  áðr, en þú hefir nú rótat í sundr skjaldborg minni, ok hafða ek nú svá
  gert hana háva utan at mér, at hún hefir hlíft mér við &#x1EB;llum
  h&#x1EB;ggum ykkar, svá <i>at</i> engi h&#x1EB;gg hafa komit á mik lengi,
  en ekki var hún enn svá búin, sem ek ætlaði hún skyldi verða."
  B&#x1EB;ðvarr mælti: "ekki muntu fá skjaldborgina lengr." H&#x1EB;ttr
  mælti ok grét: "skaltu nú bana mér, Bokki sæll?" B&#x1EB;ðvarr bað hann
  ekki hafa hátt, tók hann upp síðan ok bar hann út úr h&#x1EB;llinni ok
  til vats n&#x1EB;kkurs, sem þar var í nánd, ok gáfu fáir at þessu gaum,
  ok þó hann upp allan. Síðan gekk B&#x1EB;ðvarr til þess rúms, sem hann
  hafði áðr tekit, ok leiddi eptir sér H&#x1EB;tt ok þar setr hann
  H&#x1EB;tt hjá sér, en hann er svá hræddr, at skelfr á honum leggr ok
  liðr, en þó þykkiz hann skilja, at þessi maðr vill hjálpa sér. Eptir þat
  kveldar ok drífa menn í h&#x1EB;llina ok sjá Hrólfs kappar, at
  H&#x1EB;ttr er settr á bekk upp, ok þykkir þeim sá maðr hafa gert sik
  ærit djarfan, er þetta hefir til tekit. Ilt tillit hefir H&#x1EB;ttr, þá
  <i>er</i> hann sér kunningja sína, því <i>at</i> hann hefir ilt eitt af
  þeim reynt; hann vill lifa gjarnan ok fara aptr í beinahrúgu sína, en
  B&#x1EB;ðvarr heldr honum, svá <i>at</i> hann náir ekki í burtu at fara,
  því <i>at</i> hann þóttiz ekki jafnberr fyrir h&#x1EB;ggum þeira, ef hann
  næði þangat <!-- Page 139 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page139"></a>{139}</span>at komaz sem hann er nú. Hirðmenn hafa nú
  sama vanda, ok kasta fyrst beinum smám um þvert gólfit til B&#x1EB;ðvars
  ok Hattar. B&#x1EB;ðvarr lætr, sem hann sjái eigi þetta. H&#x1EB;ttr er
  svá hræddr, at hann tekr eigi mat né drukk, ok þykkir honum þá ok þá sem
  hann muni vera lostinn; ok nú mælti H&#x1EB;ttr til B&#x1EB;ðvars: "Bokki
  sæll, nú ferr at þér stór hnúta, ok mun þetta ætlat okkr til nauða."
  B&#x1EB;ðvarr bað hann þegja; hann setr við holan lófann ok tekr svá við
  hnútunni; þar fylgir leggrinn með; B&#x1EB;ðvarr sendi aptr hnútuna ok
  setr á þann, sem kastaði ok rétt framan í hann með svá harðri svipan, at
  hann fekk bana; sló þá miklum ótta yfir hirðmennina. Kemr nú þessi fregn
  fyrir Hrólf konung ok kappa hans upp í kastalann, at maðr mikilúðligr sé
  kominn til hallarinnar ok hafi drepit einn hirðmann hans, ok vildu þeir
  láta drepa manninn. Hrólfr konungr spurðiz eptir, hvárt hirðmaðrinn hefði
  verit saklauss drepinn. "Því var næsta," s&#x1EB;gðu þeir. Kómuz þá fyrir
  Hrólf konung &#x1EB;ll sannindi hér um. Hrólfr konungr sagði þat skyldu
  fjarri, at drepa skyldi manninn&mdash;"hafi þit hér illan vanda upp
  tekit, at berja saklausa menn beinum; er mér í því óvirðing, en yðr stór
  sk&#x1EB;mm, at gera slíkt; hefi ek jafnan rætt um þetta áðr, ok hafi þit
  at þessu engan gaum gefit, ok hygg ek, at þessi maðr muni ekki alllítill
  fyrir sér, er þér hafið nú á leitat, ok kallið hann til mín, svá
  <i>at</i> ek viti, hverr hann er." B&#x1EB;ðvarr gengr fyrir konung ok
  kveðr hann kurteisliga. Konunga spyrr hann at nafni. "Hattargriða kalla
  mik hirðmenn yðar, en B&#x1EB;ðvarr heiti ek." Konungr mælti: "hverjar
  bætr viltu bjóða mér fyrir hirðmann minn?" B&#x1EB;ðvarr segir: "til þess
  gerði hann, sem hann fekk." Konungr mælti: "viltu vera minn maðr ok skipa
  rúm hans?" B&#x1EB;ðvarr segir: "ekki neita ek, at vera yðarr maðr, ok
  munu vit ekki skiljaz svá búit, vit H&#x1EB;ttr, ok dveljaz nær þér
  báðir, heldr en þessi hefir setit, elligar vit f&#x1EB;rum burt báðir."
  Konungr mælti: "eigi sé ek at honum sæmd en ek spara ekki mat við hann."
  B&#x1EB;ðvarr gengr nú til þess rúms, sem honum líkaði, en ekki vill hann
  þat skipa, sem hinn hafði áðr; hann kippir upp í einhverjum stað þremr
  m&#x1EB;nnum, ok síðan settuz þeir H&#x1EB;ttr þar niðr ok innar í
  h&#x1EB;llinni en þeim var skipat. Heldr þótti m&#x1EB;nnum ódælt við
  B&#x1EB;ðvar, ok er þeim hinn mesti íhugi at honum. Ok sem leið at jólum,
  <!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page140"></a>{140}</span>gerðuz menn ókátir. B&#x1EB;ðvarr spyrr
  H&#x1EB;tt, hverju þetta sætti; hann segir honum, at dýr eitt hafi þar
  komit tvá vetr í samt, mikit ok ógurligt&mdash;"ok hefir vængi á bakinu
  ok flýgr þat jafnan; tvau haust hefir þat nú hingat vitjat ok gert mikinn
  skaða; á þat bíta ekki vápn, en kappar konungs koma ekki heim, þeir sem
  at eru einna mestir." B&#x1EB;ðvarr mælti: "ekki er h&#x1EB;llin svá vel
  skipuð, sem ek ætlaði, ef eitt dýr skal hér eyða ríki ok fé konungsins."
  H&#x1EB;ttr sagði: "þat er ekki dýr, heldr er þat hit mesta tr&#x1EB;ll."
  Nú kemr jólaaptann; þá mælti konungr: "nú vil ek, at menn sé kyrrir ok
  hljóðir í nótt, ok banna ek &#x1EB;llum mínum m&#x1EB;nnum at ganga í
  n&#x1EB;kkurn háska við dýrit, en fé ferr eptir því sem auðnar; menn mína
  vil ek ekki missa." Allir heita hér góðu um, at gera eptir því, sem
  konungr bauð. B&#x1EB;ðvarr leyndiz í burt um nóttina; hann lætr
  H&#x1EB;tt fara með sér, ok gerir hann þat nauðugr ok kallaði hann sér
  stýrt til bana. B&#x1EB;ðvarr segir, at betr mundi til takaz. Þeir ganga
  í burt frá h&#x1EB;llinni, ok verðr B&#x1EB;ðvarr at bera hann; svá er
  hann hræddr. Nú sjá þeir dýrit; ok því næst æpir H&#x1EB;ttr slíkt, sem
  hann má, ok kvað dyrit mundu gleypa hann. B&#x1EB;ðvarr bað bikkjuna hans
  þegja ok kastar honum niðr í mosann, ok þar liggr hann ok eigi með
  &#x1EB;llu óhræddr; eigi þorir hann heim at fara heldr. Nú gengr
  B&#x1EB;ðvarr móti dýrinu; þat hæfir honum, at sverðit er fast í
  umgj&#x1EB;rðinni, er hann vildi bregða því. B&#x1EB;ðvarr eggjar nú fast
  sverðit ok þá bragðar í umgj&#x1EB;rðinni, ok nú fær hann brugðit
  umgj&#x1EB;rðinni, svá <i>at</i> sverðit gengr úr slíðrunum, ok leggr
  þegar undir bægi dýrsins ok svá fast, at stóð í hjartanu, ok datt þá
  dýrit til jarðar dautt niðr. Eptir þat ferr hann þangat sem H&#x1EB;ttr
  liggr. B&#x1EB;ðvarr tekr hann upp ok berr þangat, sem dýrit liggr dautt.
  H&#x1EB;ttr skelfr ákaft. B&#x1EB;ðvarr mælti: "nú skaltu drekka blóð
  dýrsins." Hann er lengi tregr, en þó þorir hann víst eigi annat.
  B&#x1EB;ðvarr lætr hann drekka tvá, sopa stóra; hann lét hann ok eta
  n&#x1EB;kkut af dýrshjartanu; eptir þetta tekr B&#x1EB;ðvarr til hans, ok
  áttuz þeir við lengi. B&#x1EB;ðvarr mælti: "helzt ertu nú sterkr orðinn,
  ok ekki vænti ek, et þú hræðiz nú hirðmenn Hrólfs konungs." H&#x1EB;ttr
  sagði: "eigi mun ek þá hræðaz ok eigi þik upp frá þessu." "Vel er þá
  orðit, H&#x1EB;ttr félagi; f&#x1EB;ru vit nú til ok reisum upp dýrit ok
  búum svá um, at aðrir ætli at kvikt muni vera." <!-- Page 141 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page141"></a>{141}</span>Þeir gera nú svá. Eptir
  þat fara þeir heim ok hafa kyrt um sik, ok veit engi maðr, hvat þeir hafa
  iðjat. Konungr spyrr um morguninn, hvat þeir viti til dýrsins, hvárt þat
  hafi n&#x1EB;kkut þangat vitjat um nóttina; honum var sagt, at fé alt
  væri heilt í grindum ok ósakat. Konungr bað menn forvitnaz, hvárt engi
  sæi líkindi til, at þat hefði heim komit. Varðmenn gerðu svá ok kómu
  skjótt aptr ok s&#x1EB;gðu konungi, at dýrit færi þar ok heldr geyst at
  borginni. Konungr bað hirðmenn vera hrausta ok duga nú hvern eptir því,
  sem hann hefði hug til, ok ráða af óvætt þenna; ok svá var gert, sem
  konungr bauð, at þeir bjuggu sik til þess. Konungr horfði á dýrit ok
  mælti síðan: "enga sé ek f&#x1EB;r á dýrinu, en hverr vill nú taka kaup
  einn ok ganga í móti því?" B&#x1EB;ðvarr mælti: "þat væri næsta hrausts
  manns forvitnisbót. H&#x1EB;ttr félagi, rektu nú af þér illmælit þat, at
  menn láta, sem engi krellr né dugr muni í þer vera; far nú ok drep þú
  dýrit; máttu sjá, at engi er allfúss til annarra." "Já," sagði
  H&#x1EB;ttr, "ek mun til þessa ráðaz." Konungr mælti: "ekki veit ek,
  hvaðan þessi hreysti er at þér komin, H&#x1EB;ttr, ok mikit hefir um þik
  skipaz á skammri stundu." H&#x1EB;ttr mælti: "gef mér til sverðit
  Gullinhjalta, er þú heldr á, ok skal ek þá fella dýrit eða fá bana."
  Hrólf konungr mælti: "þetta sverð er ekki beranda nema þeim manni, sem
  bæði er góðr drengr ok hraustr." H&#x1EB;ttr sagði: "svá skaltu til ætla,
  at mér sé svá háttat." Konungr mælti: "hvat má vita, nema fleira hafi
  skipz um hagi þína, en sjá þykkir, en fæstir menn þykkjaz þik kenna, at
  þú sér enn sami maðr; nú tak við sverðinu ok njót manna bezt, ef þetta er
  til unnit." Síðan gengr H&#x1EB;ttr at dýrinu alldjarfliga ok høggr til
  þess, þá <i>er</i> hann kemr í h&#x1EB;ggfæri, ok dýrit fellr niðr dautt.
  B&#x1EB;ðvarr mælti: "sjáið nú, herra, hvat hann hefir til unnit."
  Konungr segir: "víst hefir hann mikit skipaz, en ekki hefir H&#x1EB;ttr
  einn dýrit drepit, heldr hefir þú þat gert." B&#x1EB;ðvarr segir: "vera
  má, at svá sé." Konungr segir: "vissa ek, þá <i>er</i> þú komt hér, at
  fáir mundu þínir jafningjar vera, en þat þykki mér þó þitt verk
  frægiligast, at þú hefir gert hér annan kappa, þar <i>er</i> H&#x1EB;ttr
  er, ok óvænligr þótti til mikillar giptu; ok nú vil ek <i>at</i> hann
  heiti eigi H&#x1EB;ttr lengr ok skal hann heita Hjalti upp frá þessu;
  skaltu heita eptir sverðinu Gullinhjalta." <!-- Page 142 --><span

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Then Bothvar went on his way to Leire, and came to the king's
  dwelling.</p>

  <p>Bothvar stabled his horse by the king's best horses, without asking
  leave; and then he went into the hall, and there were few men there. He
  took a seat near the door, and when he had been there a little time he
  heard a rummaging in a corner. Bothvar looked that way and saw that a
  man's hand came up out of a great heap of bones which lay there, and the
  hand was very black. Bothvar went thither and asked who was there in the
  heap of bones.</p>

  <p>Then an answer came, in a very weak voice, "Hott is my name, good
  fellow."</p>

  <p>"Why art thou here?" said Bothvar, "and what art thou doing?"</p>

  <p>Hott said, "I am making a shield-wall for myself, good fellow."</p>

  <p>Bothvar said, "Out on thee and thy shield-wall!" and gripped him and
  jerked him up out of the heap of bones.</p>

  <p>Then Hott cried out and said, "Now thou wilt be the death of me: do
  not do so. I had made it all so snug, and now thou hast scattered in
  pieces my shield-wall; and I had built it so high all round myself that
  it has protected me against all your blows, so that for long no blows
  have come upon me, and yet it was not so arranged as I meant it should
  be."</p>

  <p>Then Bothvar said, "Thou wilt not build thy shield-wall any
  longer."</p>

  <p>Hott said, weeping, "Wilt thou be the death of me, good fellow?"
  Bothvar told him not to make a noise, and then took him up and bore him
  out of the hall to some water which was close by, and washed him from
  head to foot. Few paid any heed to this.</p>

  <p>Then Bothvar went to the place which he had taken before, and led Hott
  with him, and set Hott by his side. But Hott was so afraid that he was
  trembling in every limb, and yet he seemed to know that this man would
  help him.</p>

  <p>After that it grew to evening, and men crowded into the hall: and
  Rolf's warriors saw that Hott was seated upon the bench. And it seemed to
  them that the man must be bold <!-- Page 143 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page143"></a>{143}</span>enough, who had taken upon himself to put
  him there. Hott had an ill countenance when he saw his acquaintances, for
  he had received naught but evil from them. He wished to save his life and
  go back to his bone-heap, but Bothvar held him tightly so that he could
  not go away. For Hott thought that, if he could get back into his
  bone-heap, he would not be as much exposed to their blows as he was.</p>

  <p>Now the retainers did as before; and first of all they tossed small
  bones across the floor towards Bothvar and Hott. Bothvar pretended not to
  see this. Hott was so afraid that he neither ate nor drank; and every
  moment he thought he would be smitten.</p>

  <p>And now Hott said to Bothvar, "Good fellow, now a great knuckle bone
  is coming towards thee, aimed so as to do us sore injury." Bothvar told
  him to hold his tongue, and put up the hollow of his palm against the
  knuckle bone and caught it, and the leg bone was joined on to the knuckle
  bone. Then Bothvar sent the knuckle bone back, and hurled it straight at
  the man who had thrown it, with such a swift blow that it was the death
  of him. Then great fear came over the retainers.</p>

  <p>Now news came to King Rolf and his men up in the castle that a stately
  man had come to the hall and killed a retainer, and that the retainers
  wished to kill the man. King Rolf asked whether the retainer who had been
  killed had given any offence. "Next to none," they said: then all the
  truth of the matter came up before King Rolf.</p>

  <p>King Rolf said that it should be far from them to kill the man: "You
  have taken up an evil custom here in pelting men with bones without
  quarrel. It is a dishonour to me and a great shame to you to do so. I
  have spoken about it before, and you have paid no attention. I think that
  this man whom you have assailed must be a man of no small valour. Call
  him to me, so that I may know who he is."</p>

  <p>Bothvar went before the king and greeted him courteously. The king
  asked him his name. "Your retainers call me Hott's protector, but my name
  is Bothvar."</p>

  <p>The king said, "What compensation wilt thou offer me for my retainer?"
  <!-- Page 144 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page144"></a>{144}</span></p>

  <p>Bothvar said, "He only got what he asked for."</p>

  <p>The king said, "Wilt thou become my man and fill his place?"</p>

  <p>Bothvar said, "I do not refuse to be your man, but Hott and I must not
  part so. And we must sit nearer to thee than this man whom I have slain
  has sat; otherwise we will both depart together." The king said, "I do
  not see much credit in Hott, but I will not grudge him meat." Then
  Bothvar went to the seat that seemed good to him, and would not fill that
  which the other had before. He pulled up three men in one place, and then
  he and Hott sat down there higher in the hall than the place which had
  been given to them. The men thought Bothvar overbearing, and there was
  the greatest ill will among them concerning him.</p>

  <p>And when it drew near to Christmas, men became gloomy. Bothvar asked
  Hott the reason of this. Hott said to him that for two winters together a
  wild beast had come, great and awful, "And it has wings on its back, and
  flies. For two autumns it has attacked us here and done much damage. No
  weapon will wound it: and the champions of the king, those who are the
  greatest, come not back."</p>

  <p>Bothvar said, "This hall is not so well arrayed as I thought, if one
  beast can lay waste the kingdom and the cattle of the king." Hott said,
  "It is no beast: it is the greatest troll."</p>

  <p>Now Christmas-eve came; then said the king, "Now my will is that men
  to-night be still and quiet, and I forbid all my men to run into any
  peril with this beast. It must be with the cattle as fate will have it:
  but I do not wish to lose my men." All men promised to do as the king
  commanded. But Bothvar went out in secret that night; he caused Hott to
  go with him, but Hott did that only under compulsion, and said that it
  would be the death of him. Bothvar said that he hoped that it would be
  better than that. They went away from the hall, and Bothvar had to carry
  Hott, so frightened was he. Now they saw the beast; and thereupon Hott
  cried out as loud as he could, and said that the beast would swallow him.
  Bothvar said, "Be silent, thou dog," and threw him down in the mire. And
  there he lay in no small fear; but he did not dare to go home, any the
  more. <!-- Page 145 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page145"></a>{145}</span></p>

  <p>Now Bothvar went against the beast, and it happened that his sword was
  fast in his sheath when he wished to draw it. Bothvar now tugged at his
  sword, it moved, he wrenched the scabbard so that the sword came out. And
  at once he plunged it into the beast's shoulder so mightily that it
  pierced him to the heart, and the beast fell down dead to the earth.
  After that Bothvar went where Hott lay. Bothvar took him up and bore him
  to where the beast lay dead. Hott was trembling all over. Bothvar said,
  "Now must thou drink the blood of the beast." For long Hott was
  unwilling, and yet he did not dare to do anything else. Bothvar made him
  drink two great sups; also he made him eat somewhat of the heart of the
  beast.</p>

  <p>After that Bothvar turned to Hott, and they fought a long time.</p>

  <p>Bothvar said, "Thou hast now become very strong, and I do not believe
  that thou wilt now fear the retainers of King Rolf."</p>

  <p>Hott said, "I shall not fear them, nor thee either, from now on."</p>

  <p>"That is good, fellow Hott. Let us now go and raise up the beast, and
  so array him that others may think that he is still alive." And they did
  so. After that they went home, and were quiet, and no man knew what they
  had achieved.</p>

  <p>In the morning the king asked what news there was of the beast, and
  whether it had made any attack upon them in the night. And answer was
  made to the king, that all the cattle were safe and uninjured in their
  folds. The king bade his men examine whether any trace could be seen of
  the beast having visited them. The watchers did so, and came quickly back
  to the king with the news that the beast was making for the castle, and
  in great fury. The king bade his retainers be brave, and each play the
  man according as he had spirit, and do away with this monster. And they
  did as the king bade, and made them ready.</p>

  <p>Then the king faced towards the beast and said, "I see no sign of
  movement in the beast. Who now will undertake to go against it?"</p>

  <p>Bothvar said, "That would be an enterprise for a man of true valour.
  Fellow Hott, now clear thyself of that ill-repute, <!-- Page 146 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page146"></a>{146}</span>in that men hold that
  there is no spirit or valour in thee. Go now and do thou kill the beast;
  thou canst see that there is no one else who is forward to do it."</p>

  <p>"Yea," said Hott, "I will undertake this."</p>

  <p>The king said, "I do not know whence this valour has come upon thee,
  Hott; and much has changed in thee in a short time."</p>

  <p>Hott said, "Give me the sword Goldenboss, Gullinhjalti, which thou
  dost wield, and I will fell the beast or take my death." Rolf the king
  said, "That sword cannot be borne except by a man who is both a good
  warrior and valiant." Hott said, "So shalt thou ween that I am a man of
  that kind." The king said, "How can one know that more has not changed in
  thy temper than can be seen? Few men would know thee for the same man.
  Now take the sword and have joy of it, if this deed is accomplished."
  Then Hott went boldly to the beast and smote at it when he came within
  reach, and the beast fell down dead. Bothvar said, "See now, my lord,
  what he has achieved." The king said, "Verily, he has altered much, but
  Hott has not killed the beast alone, rather hast thou done it." Bothvar
  said, "It may be that it is so." The king said, "I knew when thou didst
  come here that few would be thine equals. But this seems to me
  nevertheless thy most honourable work, that thou hast made here another
  warrior of Hott, who did not seem shaped for much luck. And now I will
  that he shall be called no longer Hott, but Hjalti from this time; thou
  shalt be called after the sword Gullinhjalti (Goldenboss)."</p>

  átti jafnmart ganganda fé, sem hann. Ekki var hann h&#x1EB;fðingi, en þó
  skilríkr bóndí. Þar var reimt mj&#x1EB;k, ok fekk hann varla sauðamann,
  svá at honum þ&oelig;tti duga. Hann leitaði ráðs við marga vitra menn,
  hvat hann skyldi til bragðs taka; en engi gat þat ráð til gefit, er
  dygði. Þórhallr reið til þings hvert sumar. Hann átti hesta góða. Þat var
  eitt sumar á alþingi, at Þórhallr gekk til búðar Skapta l&#x1EB;gmanns,
  Þóroddssonar. Skapti var manna vitrastr, ok heilráðr, ef hann var beiddr.
  Þat skildi með þeim feðgum: Þóroddr var forspár ok kallaðr
  undirhyggjumaðr af sumum m&#x1EB;nnum, en Skapti lagði þat til með
  hverjum manni, sem hann ætlaði at duga skyldi, ef eigi væri af því
  brugðit; því var hann kallaðr betrfeðrungr. Þórhallr gekk í búð Skapta;
  hann fagnaði vel Þórhalli, því hann vissi, at hann var ríkr maðr at fé,
  ok spurði hvat at tíðendum væri.</p>

  <p>Þórhallr mælti: "Heilræði vilda ek af yðr þiggja."</p>

  <p>"Í litlum f&oelig;rum em ek til þess," sagði Skapti; "eða hvat stendr
  þik?"</p>

  <p>Þórhallr mælti: "Þat er svá háttat, at mér helz lítt á
  sauðam&#x1EB;nnum. Verðr þeim heldr klakksárt, en sumir gera engar lyktir
  á. Vill nú engi til taka, sá er kunnigt er til, hvat fyrir býr."</p>

  <p>Skapti svarar: "Þar mun liggja meinvættr n&#x1EB;kkur, er menn eru
  tregari til at geyma síðr þíns fjár en annarra manna. Nú fyrir því, at þú
  hefir at mér ráð sótt, þá skal ek fá þér sauðamann, þann er Glámr heitir,
  ættaðr ór Svíþjóð, ór Sylgsd&#x1EB;lum, er út kom í fyrra sumar, mikill
  ok sterkr, ok ekki mj&#x1EB;k við alþýðu skap."</p>

  <p>Þórhallr kvaz ekki um þat gefa, ef hann geymdi vel fjárins; Skapti
  sagði &#x1EB;ðrum eigi vænt horfa, ef hann geymdi eigi fyrir afls sakir
  ok áræðis; Þórhallr gekk þá út. Þetta var at þinglausnum.</p>

  <p>Þórhalli var vant hesta tveggja ljósbleikra, ok fór sjálfr at leita;
  af því þykkjaz menn vita, at hann var ekki mikilmenni. Hann gekk upp
  undir Sleðás ok suðr með fjalli því, er Ármannsfell heitir. Þá sá hann,
  hvar maðr fór ofan ór Goðaskógi ok bar hrís á hesti. Brátt bar saman fund
  þeira; Þórhallr spurði hann at nafni, en hann kvez Glámr heita. Þessi
  maðr <!-- Page 148 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page148"></a>{148}</span>var mikill vexti ok undarligr í
  yfirbragði, bláeygðr ok opineygðr, úlfgrár á hárslit. Þórhalli brá
  n&#x1EB;kkut í brún, er hann sá þenna mann; en þó skildi hann, at honum
  mundi til þessa vísat.</p>

  <p>"Hvat er þér bezt hent at vinna?" segir Þórhallr.</p>

  <p>Glámr kvað sér vel hent at geyma sauðfjár á vetrum.</p>

  <p>"Viltu geyma sauðfjár míns?" segir Þórhallr; "gaf Skapti þik á mitt
  vald."</p>

  <p>"Svá mun þér hentust mín vist, at ek fari sjálfráðr; því ek em
  skapstyggr, ef mér líkar eigi vel," sagði Glámr.</p>

  <p>"Ekki mun mér mein at því," segir Þórhallr, "ok vil ek, at þú farir
  til mín."</p>

  <p>"Gera má ek þat," segir Glámr; "eða eru þar n&#x1EB;kkur
  vandh&oelig;fi á?"</p>

  <p>"Reimt þykkir þar vera," sagði Þórhallr.</p>

  <p>"Ekki hræðumz ek flykur þær," sagði Glámr, "ok þykkir mér at
  ódauflig[r]a."</p>

  <p>"Þess muntu við þurfa," segir Þórhallr, "ok hentar þar betr, at vera
  eigi alllítill fyrir sér."</p>

  <p>Eptir þat kaupa þeir saman, ok skal Glámr koma at vetrnóttum. Siðan
  skildu þeir, ok fann Þórhallr hesta sína, þar sem hann hafði nýleitat.
  Reið Þórhallr heim, ok þakkaði Skapta sinn velgerning.</p>

  <p>Sumar leið af, ok frétti Þórhallr ekki til sauðamanns, ok engi kunni
  skyn á honum. En at ánefndum tíma kom hann á Þórhallsstaði. Tekr bóndi
  við honum vel, en &#x1EB;llum &#x1EB;ðrum gaz ekki at honum, en húsfreyju
  þó minst. Hann tók við fjárvarðveizlu, ok varð honum lítit fyrir því;
  hann var hljóðmikill ok dimmraddaðr, ok féit st&#x1EB;kk allt saman,
  þegar hann hóaði. Kirkja var á Þórhallsst&#x1EB;ðum; ekki vildi Glámr til
  hennar koma; hann var ós&#x1EB;ngvinn ok trúlauss, stirfinn ok
  viðskotaillr; &#x1EB;llum var hann hvimleiðr.</p>

  <p>Nú leið svá þar til er kemr atfangadagr jóla. Þá stóð Glámr snemma upp
  ok kallaði til matar síns.</p>

  <p>Húsfreyja svarar: "Ekki er þat háttr kristinna manna, at mataz þenna
  dag, þvíat á morgin er jóladagr hinn fyrsti," segir hon, "ok er því fyrst
  skylt at fasta í dag."</p>

  <p>Hann svarar: "Marga hindrvitni hafi þér, þá er ek sé til enskis koma.
  Veit ek eigi, at m&#x1EB;nnum fari nú betr at, heldr <!-- Page 149
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page149"></a>{149}</span>en þá, er menn
  fóru ekki með slíkt. Þótti mér þá betri siðr, er menn váru heiðnir
  kallaðir; ok vil ek mat minn en engar refjur."</p>

  <p>Húsfreyja mælti: "Víst veit ek, at þér mun illa faraz í dag, ef þú
  tekr þetta illbrigði til."</p>

  <p>Glámr bað hana taka mat í stað; kvað henni annat skyldu vera verra.
  Hon þorði eigi annat, en at gera, sem hann vildi. Ok er hann var mettr,
  gekk hann út, ok var heldr gustillr. Veðri var svá farit, at myrkt var um
  at litaz, ok fl&#x1EB;graði ór drífa, ok gnýmikit, ok versnaði mj&#x1EB;k
  sem á leið daginn. Heyrðu menn til sauðamanns &#x1EB;ndverðan daginn, en
  miðr er á leið daginn. Tók þá at fjúka, ok gerði á hríð um kveldit; kómu
  menn til tíða, ok leið svá fram at dagsetri; eigi kom Glámr heim. Var þá
  um talat, hvárt hans skyldi eigi leita; en fyrir því, at hríð var á ok
  niðamyrkr, þá varð ekki af leitinni. Kom hann eigi heim jólanóttina; biðu
  menn svá fram um tíðir. At &oelig;rnum degi fóru menn í leitina, ok fundu
  féit víða í f&#x1EB;nnum, lamit af ofviðri eða hlaupit á fj&#x1EB;ll upp.
  Þvínæst kómu þeir á traðk mikinn ofarliga í dalnum. Þótti þeim því líkt,
  sem þar hefði glímt verit heldr sterkliga, þvíat grjótit var víða upp
  leyst, ok svá j&#x1EB;rðin. Þeir hugðu at vandliga ok sá, hvar Glámr lá,
  skamt á brott frá þeim. Hann var dauðr, ok blár sem Hel, en digr sem
  naut. Þeim bauð af honum óþekt mikla, ok hraus þeim mj&#x1EB;k hugr við
  honum. En þó leituðu þeir við at f&oelig;ra hann til kirkju, ok gátu ekki
  komit honum, nema á einn gilsþr&#x1EB;m þar skamt ofan frá sér; ok fóru
  heim við svá búit, ok s&#x1EB;gðu bónda þenna atburð. Hann spurði, hvat
  Glámi mundi hafa at bana orðit. Þeir kváðuz rakit hafa spor svá stór, sem
  keraldsbotni væri niðr skelt þaðan frá, sem traðkrinn var, ok upp undir
  bj&#x1EB;rg þau, er þar váru ofarliga í dalnum, ok fylgðu þar með
  blóðdrefjar miklar. Þat drógu menn saman, at sú meinvættr, er áðr hafði
  [þar] verit, mundi hafa deytt Glám; en hann mundi fengit hafa henni
  n&#x1EB;kkurn áverka, þann er tekit hafi til fulls, þvíat við þá
  meinvætti hefir aldri vart orðit síðan. Annan jóladag var enn til farit
  at f&oelig;ra Glám til kirkju. Váru eykir fyrir beittir, ok gátu þeir
  hvergi f&oelig;rt hann, þegar sléttlendit var ok eigi var forbrekkis at
  fara. Gengu nú frá við svá búit. Hinn þriðja dag fór prestr með þeim, ok
  leituðu allan daginn, <!-- Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page150"></a>{150}</span>ok Glámr fannz eigi. Eigi vildi prestr
  optar til fara; en sauðamaðr fannz, þegar prestr var eigi í ferð. Létu
  þeir þá fyrir vinnaz, at f&oelig;ra hann til kirkju; ok dysjuðu hann þar,
  sem þá var hann kominn. Lítlu síðar urðu menn varir við þat, at Glámr lá
  eigi kyrr. Varð m&#x1EB;nnum at því mikit mein, svá at margir fellu í
  óvit, ef sá hann, en sumir heldu eigi vitinu. Þegar eptir jólin þóttuz
  menn sjá hann heima þar á b&oelig;num. Urðu menn ákafliga hræddir; stukku
  þá margir menn í brott. Þvinæst tók Glámr at ríða húsum á nætr, svá at lá
  við brotum. Gekk hann þá náliga nætr ok daga. Varla þorðu menn at fara
  upp í dalinn, þóat ætti nóg ørendi. Þótti m&#x1EB;nnum þar í heraðinu
  mikit mein at þessu.</p>

  <p>Um várit fekk Þórhallr sér hjón ok gerði bú á j&#x1EB;rðu sinni. Tók
  þá at minka aptrgangr, meðan sólargangr var mestr. Leið svá fram á
  miðsumar. Þetta sumar kom út skip í Húnavatni; þar var á sá maðr, er
  Þorgautr hét. Hann var útlendr at kyni, mikill ok sterkr; hann hafði
  tveggja manna afl; hann var lauss ok einn fyrir sér; hann vildi fá starfa
  n&#x1EB;kkurn, því(at) hann var félauss. Þórhallr reið til skips ok fann
  Þorgaut; spurði ef hann vildi vinna fyrir honum; Þorgautr kvað þat vel
  mega vera, ok kvez eigi vanda þat.</p>

  <p>"Svá skaltu við búaz," segir Þórhallr, "sem þar sé ekki
  veslingsm&#x1EB;nnum hent at vera, fyrir aptrg&#x1EB;ngum þeim, er þar
  hafa verit um hríð, en ek vil ekki þik á tálar draga."</p>

  <p>Þorgautr svarar: "Eigi þykkjumz ek upp gefinn, þóat ek sjá smáváfur;
  mun þá eigi &#x1EB;ðrum dælt, ef ek hræðumz; ok ekki bregð ek vist minni
  fyrir þat."</p>

  <p>Nú semr þeim vel kaupstefnan, ok skal Þorgautr gæta sauðfjár at
  vetri.</p>

  <p>Leið nú af sumarit. Tók Þorgautr við fénu at vetrnáttum. Vel líkaði
  &#x1EB;llum við hann. Jafnan kom Glámr heim ok reið húsum. Þat þótti
  Þorgauti allkátligt, ok kvað, "þrælinn þurfa mundu nær at ganga, ef ek
  hræðumz." Þórhallr bað hann hafa fátt um; "er bezt, at þit reynið ekki
  með ykkr."</p>

  <p>Þorgautr mælti: "Sannliga er skekinn þróttr ór yðr; ok dett ek eigi
  niðr milli d&oelig;gra við skraf þetta."</p>

  <p>Nú fór svá fram um vetrinn allt til jóla. Atfangakveld jóla fór
  sauðamaðr til fjár. <!-- Page 151 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page151"></a>{151}</span></p>

  <p>Þá mælti húsfreyja: "Þurfa þ&oelig;tti mér, at nú f&oelig;ri eigi at
  fornum br&#x1EB;gðum."</p>

  <p>Hann svarar: "Ver eigi hrædd um þat, húsfreyja," sagði hann; "verða
  mun eitthvert s&#x1EB;guligt, ef ek kem ekki aptr." Síðan gekk hann aptr
  til fjár síns. Veðr var heldr kalt, ok fjúk mikit. Því var Þorgautr vanr,
  at koma heim, þá er hálfrøkkvat var; en nú kom hann ekki heim í þat mund.
  Kómu tíðamenn, sem vant var. Þat þótti m&#x1EB;nnum eigi ólíkt á horfaz
  sem fyrr. Bóndi vildi leita láta eptir sauðamanni, en tíðamenn
  t&#x1EB;lduz undan, ok s&#x1EB;gðuz eigi mundu hætta sér út í
  tr&#x1EB;llahendr um nætr; ok treystiz bóndi eigi at fara, ok varð ekki
  af leitinni. Jóladag, er menn váru mettir, fóru menn til ok leituðu
  sauðamanns. Gengu þeir fyrst til dysjar Gláms, þvíat menn ætluðu af hans
  v&#x1EB;ldum mundi orðit um hvarf sauðamanns. En er þeir kómu nær
  dysinni, sáu þeir þar mikil tíðendi, ok þar fundu þeir sauðamann, ok var
  hann brotinn á háls, ok lamit sundr hvert bein í honum. Síðan f&oelig;rðu
  þeir hann til kirkju, ok varð engum manni mein at Þorgauti síðan. En
  Glámr tók at magnaz af nýju. Gerði hann nú svá mikit af sér, at menn
  allir stukku brott af Þórhallsst&#x1EB;ðum, útan bóndi einn ok húsfreyja.
  Nautamaðr hafði þar verit lengi hinn sami. Vildi Þórhallr hann ekki
  lausan láta fyrir góðvilja sakir ok geymslu. Hann var mj&#x1EB;k við
  aldr, ok þótti honum mikit fyrir, at fara á brott; sá hann ok, at allt
  fór at ónytju, þat er bóndi átti, ef engi geymdi. Ok einn tíma eptir
  miðjan vetr var þat einn morgin, at húsfreyja fór til fjóss, at mjólka
  kýr eptir tíma. Þá var alljóst, þvíat engi treystiz fyrr úti at vera
  annarr en nautamaðr; hann fór út, þegar lýsti. Hon heyrði brak mikit í
  fjósit, ok beljan &#x1EB;skurliga; hon hljóp inn &oelig;pandi ok kvaz
  eigi vita, hver ód&oelig;mi um væri í fjósinu. Bóndi gekk út ok kom til
  nautanna, ok stangaði hvert annat. Þótti honum þar eigi gott, ok gekk
  innar at hl&#x1EB;ðunni. Hann sá, hvar lá, nautamaðr, ok hafði
  h&#x1EB;fuðit í &#x1EB;ðrum bási en f&oelig;tr í &#x1EB;ðrum; hann lá á
  bak aptr. Bóndi gekk at honum ok þreifaði um hann; finnr brátt, at hann
  er dauðr ok sundr hryggrinn í honum. Var hann brotinn um báshelluna. Nú
  þótti bónda eigi vært, ok fór í brott af b&oelig;num með allt þat, sem
  hann mátti í brott flytja. En allt kvikfé þat, sem eptir var, deyddi
  Glámr. Ok þvinæst fór <!-- Page 152 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page152"></a>{152}</span>hann um allan dalinn ok eyddi alla
  b&oelig;i upp frá Tungu. Var Þórhallr þá með vinum sínum þat [sem] eptir
  var vetrarins. Engi maðr mátti fara upp í dalinn með hest eðr hund, þvíat
  þat var þegar drepit. En er váraði, ok sólargangr var sem mestr, létti
  heldr aptrg&#x1EB;ngunum. Vildi Þórhallr nú fara aptr til lands síns.
  Urðu honum ekki auðfengin hjón, en þó gerði hann bú á
  Þórhallsst&#x1EB;ðum. Fór allt á sama veg sem fyrr; þegar at haustaði,
  tóku at vaxa reimleikar. Var þá mest sótt at bóndadóttur; ok svá fór, at
  hon léz af því. Margra ráða var í leitat, ok varð ekki at g&#x1EB;rt.
  Þótti m&#x1EB;nnum til þess horfaz, at eyðaz mundi allr Vatnsdalr, ef
  eigi yrði b&oelig;tr á ráðnar.</p>

  <p>Nú er þar til at taka, at Grettir Ásmundarson sat heima at Bjargi um
  haustit, síðan þeir Vígabarði skildu á Þóreyjargnúpi. Ok er mj&#x1EB;k
  var komit at vetrnóttum, reið Grettir heiman norðr yfir hálsa til
  Víðidals, ok gisti á Auðunarst&#x1EB;ðum. Sættuz þeir Auðunn til fulls,
  ok gaf Grettir honum øxi góða, ok mæltu til vináttu með sér. Auðunn bjó
  lengi á Auðunarst&#x1EB;ðum ok var kynsæll maðr. Hans sonr var Egill, er
  átti Úlfheiði, dóttur Eyjólfs Guðmundarsonar, ok var þeira sonr Eyjólfr,
  er veginn var á alþingi. Hann var faðir Orms, kapiláns Þorláks biskups.
  Grettir reið norðr til Vatnsdals ok kom á kynnisleit í Tungu. Þar bjó þá
  J&#x1EB;kull Bárðarson, móðurbróðir Grettis; J&#x1EB;kull var mikill maðr
  ok sterkr ok hinn mesti ofsamaðr. Hann var siglingamaðr, ok mj&#x1EB;k
  ódæll, en þó mikilh&oelig;fr maðr. Hann tók vel við Gretti, ok var hann
  þar þrjár nætr. Þá var svá mikit orð á aptrg&#x1EB;ngum Gláms, at
  m&#x1EB;nnum var ekki jafntíðr&oelig;tt sem þat. Grettir spurði inniliga
  at þeim atburðum, er h&#x1EB;fðu orðit; J&#x1EB;kull kvað þar ekki meira
  af sagt en til væri h&oelig;ft; "eða er þér forvitni á, frændi! at koma
  þar?"</p>

  <p>Grettir sagði, at þat var satt.</p>

  <p>J&#x1EB;kull bað hann þat eigi gera, "því þat er gæfuraun mikil; en
  frændr þínir eiga mikit í hættu, þar sem þú ert," sagði hann; "þykkir oss
  nú engi slíkr af ungum m&#x1EB;nnum sem þú; en illt mun af illum hljóta,
  þar sem Glámr er. Er ok miklu betra, at fáz við mennska menn en við
  óvættir slíkar."</p>

  <p>Grettir kvað sér hug á, at koma á Þórhallsstaði, ok sjá, hversu þar
  væri um gengit. <!-- Page 153 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page153"></a>{153}</span></p>

  <p>J&#x1EB;kull mælti: "Sé ek nú, at eigi tjáir at letja þik; en satt er
  þat sem mælt er, at sitt er hvárt, gæfa eða gervigleikr."</p>

  <p>"Þá er &#x1EB;ðrum vá fyrir dyrum, er &#x1EB;ðrum er inn um komit; ok
  hygg at, hversu þér mun fara sjálfum, áðr lýkr," kvað Grettir.</p>

  <p>J&#x1EB;kull svarar: "Vera kann, at vit sjáim báðir n&#x1EB;kkut fram,
  en hvárrgi fái við g&#x1EB;rt."</p>

  <p>Eptir þat skildu þeir, ok líkaði hvárigum annars spár.</p>

  <p>Grettir reið á Þórhallsstaði, ok fagnaði bóndi honum vel. Hann spurði,
  hvert Grettir ætlaði at fara; en hann segiz þar vilja vera um nóttina, ef
  bónda líkaði, at svá væri. Þórhallr kvaz þ&#x1EB;kk fyrir kunna, at hann
  væri þar, "en fám þykkir sl&oelig;gr til at gista hér um tíma; muntu hafa
  heyrt getit um, hvat hér er at væla. En ek vilda gjarna, at þú hlytir
  engi vandræði af mér. En þóat þú komiz heill á brott, þá veit ek fyrir
  víst, at þú missir hests þíns; því engi heldr hér heilum sínum
  fararskjóta, sá er kemr."</p>

  <p>Grettir kvað gott til hesta, hvat sem af þessum yrði.</p>

  <p>Þórhallr varð glaðr við, er Grettir vildi þar vera, ok tók við honum
  báðum h&#x1EB;ndum. Var hestr Grettis læstr í húsi sterkliga. Þeir fóru
  til svefns, ok leið svá af nóttin, at ekki kom Glámr heim.</p>

  <p>Þá mælti Þórhallr: "Vel hefir brugðit við þína kvámu, þvíat hverja
  nótt er Glámr vanr at ríða húsum eða brjóta upp hurðir, sem þú mátt merki
  sjá."</p>

  <p>Grettir mælti: "Þá mun vera annathvárt, at hann mun ekki lengi á sér
  sitja, eða mun af venjaz meirr en eina nótt. Skal ek vera hér nótt aðra
  ok sjá, hversu ferr."</p>

  <p>Siðan gengu þeir til hests Grettis, ok var ekki við hann glez. Allt
  þótti bónda at einu fara. Nú er Grettir þar aðra nótt, ok kom ekki
  þrællinn heim. Þá þótti bónda mj&#x1EB;k vænkaz. Fór hann þá, at sjá hest
  Grettis. Þá var upp brotit húsit, er bóndi kom til, en hestrinn dreginn
  til dyra útar, ok lamit í sundr í honum hvert bein.</p>

  <p>Þórhallr sagði Gretti, hvar þá var komit, ok bað hann forða sér:
  "þvíat víss er dauðinn, ef þú bíðr Gláms."</p>

  <p>Grettir svarar: "Eigi má ek minna hafa fyrir hest minn, en at sjá
  þrælinn." <!-- Page 154 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page154"></a>{154}</span></p>

  <p>Bóndi sagði, at þat var eigi bati, at sjá hann, "þvíat hann er ólíkr
  n&#x1EB;kkurri mannligri mynd; en góð þykki mér hver sú stund, er þú vilt
  hér vera."</p>

  <p>Nú líðr dagrinn; ok er menn skyldu fara til svefns, vildi Grettir eigi
  fara af klæðum, ok lagðiz niðr í setit gegnt lokrekkju bónda. Hann hafði
  r&#x1EB;ggvarfeld yfir sér, ok knepti annat skautit niðr undir f&oelig;tr
  sér, en annat snaraði hann undir h&#x1EB;fuð sér, ok sá út um
  h&#x1EB;fuðsmáttina. Setstokkr var fyrir framan setit, mj&#x1EB;k sterkr,
  ok spyrndi hann þar í. Dyraumbúningrinn allr var frá brotinn útidyrunum,
  en nú var þar fyrir bundinn hurðarflaki, ok óvendiliga um búit. Þverþilit
  var allt brotit frá skálanum, þat sem þar fyrir framan hafði verit, bæði
  fyrir ofan þvertréit ok neðan. Sængr allar váru ór stað f&oelig;rðar.
  Heldr var þar óvistuligt. Ljós brann í skálanum um nóttina. Ok er af
  mundi þriðjungr af nótt, heyrði Grettir út dynur miklar. Var þá farit upp
  á húsin, ok riðit skálanum ok barit hælunum, svá at brakaði í hverju tré.
  Þvi gekk lengi; þá var farit ofan af húsunum ok til dyra gengit. Ok er
  upp var lokit hurðunni, sá Grettir, at þrællinn rétti inn h&#x1EB;fuðit,
  ok sýndiz honum afskræmiliga mikit ok undarliga stórskorit. Glámr fór
  seint ok réttiz upp, er hann kom inn í dyrnar; hann gnæfaði ofarliga við
  ræfrinu; snýr at skálanum ok lagði handleggina upp á þvertréit, ok gægðiz
  inn yfir skálann. Ekki lét bóndi heyra til sín, þvíat honum þótti
  &oelig;rit um, er hann heyrði, hvat um var úti. Grettir lá kyrr ok
  hr&oelig;rði sik hvergi. Glámr sá, at hrúga n&#x1EB;kkur lá í setinu, ok
  réz nú innar eptir skálanum ok þreif í feldinn stundarfast. Grettir
  spyrndi í stokkinn, ok gekk því hvergi. Glámr hnykti í annat sinn miklu
  fastara, ok bifaðiz hvergi feldrinn. Í þriðja sinn þreif hann í með báðum
  h&#x1EB;ndum svá fast, at hann rétti Gretti upp ór setinu; kiptu nú í
  sundr feldinum í millum sín. Glámr leit á slitrit, er hann helt á, ok
  undraðiz mj&#x1EB;k, hverr svá, fast mundi togaz við hann. Ok í því hljóp
  Grettir undir hendr honum, ok þreif um hann miðjan, ok spenti á honum
  hrygginn sem fastast gat hann, ok ætlaði hann, at Glámr skyldi kikna við.
  En þrællinn lagði at handleggjum Grettis svá fast, at hann h&#x1EB;rfaði
  allr fyrir orku sakir. Fór Grettir þá undan í ýms setin. Gengu þá frá
  stokkarnir, ok allt brotnaði, þat sem fyrir varð. Vildi <!-- Page 155
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page155"></a>{155}</span>Glámr leita
  út, en Grettir f&oelig;rði við f&oelig;tr, hvar sem hann mátti. En þó gat
  Glámr dregit hann fram ór skálanum. Áttu þeir þá allharða sókn þvíat
  þrællinn ætlaði at koma honum út ór b&oelig;num; en svá illt sem var at
  eiga við Glám inni, þá sá Grettir, at þó var verra, at fáz við hann úti;
  ok því brauz hann í móti af &#x1EB;llu afli at fara út. Glámr
  f&oelig;rðiz í aukana, ok knepti hann at sér, er þeir kómu í anddyrit. Ok
  er Grettir sér, at hann fekk eigi við spornat, hefir hann allt eitt
  atriðit, at hann hleypr sem harðast í fang þrælnum ok spyrnir báðum fótum
  í jarðfastan stein, er stoð í dyrunum. Við þessu bjóz þrællinn eigi; hann
  hafði þá togaz við at draga Gretti at sér; ok því kiknaði Glámr á bak
  aptr, ok rauk &#x1EB;fugr út á dyrnar, svá at herðarnar námu uppdyrit, ok
  ræfrit gekk í sundr, bæði viðirnir ok þekjan frerin; fell hann svá opinn
  ok &#x1EB;fugr út ór húsunum, en Grettir á hann ofan. Tunglskin var mikit
  úti ok gluggaþykkn; hratt stundum fyrir, en stundum dró frá. Nú í því, er
  Glámr fell, rak skýit frá tunglinu, en Glámr hvesti augun upp í móti. Ok
  svá, hefir Grettir sagt sjálfr, at þá eina sýn hafi hann sét svá, at
  honum brygði við. Þá sigaði svá at honum af &#x1EB;llu saman, m&oelig;ði
  ok því, er hann sá at Glámr gaut sínum sjónum harðliga, at hann gat eigi
  brugðit saxinu, ok lá náliga í milli heims ok heljar. En því var meiri
  ófagnaðarkraptr með Glámi en flestum &#x1EB;ðrum
  aptrg&#x1EB;ngum&#x1EB;nnum, at hann mælti þá á þessa leið: "Mikit kapp
  hefir þú á lagit, Grettir," sagði hann, "at finna mik. En þat mun eigi
  undarligt þykkja, þóat þú hljótir ekki mikit happ af mér. En þat má ek
  segja þér, at þú hefir nú fengit helming afls þess ok þroska, er þér var
  ætlaðr, ef þú hefðir mik ekki fundit. Nú fæ ek þat afl eigi af þér tekit,
  er þú hefir áðr hrept; en því má ek ráða, at þú verðr aldri sterkari en
  nú ertu, ok ertu þó nógu sterkr, ok at því mun m&#x1EB;rgum verða. Þú
  hefir frægr orðit hér til af verkum þínum; en heðan af munu falla til þín
  sektir ok vígaferli, en flest &#x1EB;ll verk þín snúaz þér til ógæfu ok
  hamingjuleysis. Þú munt verða útlægr g&#x1EB;rr, ok hljóta jafnan úti at
  búa einn samt. Þá legg ek þat á við þik, at þessi augu sé þér jafnan
  fyrir sjónum, sem ek ber eptir; ok mun þér erfitt þykkja, einum at vera;
  ok þat mun þér til dauða draga."</p>

  <p>Ok sem þrællinn hafði þetta mælt, þá rann af Gretti ómegin, <!-- Page
  156 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page156"></a>{156}</span>þat sem á
  honum hafði verit. Brá hann þá saxinu ok hjó h&#x1EB;fuð af Glámi ok
  setti þat við þjó honum. Bóndi kom þá út, ok hafði klæz, á meðan Glámr
  lét ganga t&#x1EB;luna; en hvergi þorði hann nær at koma, fyrr en Glámr
  var fallinn. Þórhallr lofaði guð fyrir, ok þakkaði vel Gretti, er hann
  hafði unnit þenna óhreina anda. Fóru þeir þá til, ok brendu Glám at
  k&#x1EB;ldum kolum. Eptir þat [báru þeir &#x1EB;sku hans í eina hít ok]
  grófu þar niðr, sem sízt váru fjárhagar eða mannavegir. Gengu heim eptir
  þat, ok var þá mj&#x1EB;k komit at degi. Lagðiz Grettir niðr, þvíat hann
  var stirðr mj&#x1EB;k. Þórhallr sendi menn á næstu b&oelig;i eptir
  m&#x1EB;nnum; sýndi ok sagði, hversu farit hafði. &#x1EA;llum þótti
  mikils um vert um þetta verk, þeim er heyrðu. Var þat þá almælt, at engi
  væri þvílíkr maðr á &#x1EB;llu landinu fyrir afls sakir ok hreysti ok
  allrar atgervi, sem Grettir Ásmundarson.</p>

  <p>Þórhallr leysti Gretti vel af garði ok gaf honum góðan hest ok klæði
  s&oelig;milig, því[at] þau váru &#x1EB;ll sundr leyst, er hann hafði áðr
  borit. Skildu þeir með vináttu. Reið Grettir þaðan í Ás í Vatnsdal, ok
  tók Þorvaldr við honum vel ok spurði inniliga at sameign þeira Gláms; en
  Grettir segir honum viðskipti þeira, ok kvaz aldri í þvílíka aflraun
  komit hafa, svá langa viðreign sem þeir h&#x1EB;fðu saman átt.</p>

  <p>Þorvaldr bað hann hafa sik spakan, "ok mun þá vel duga, en ella mun
  þér slysgjarnt verða."</p>

  <p>Grettir kvað ekki batnat hafa um lyndisbragðit, ok sagðiz nú miklu
  verr stiltr en áðr, ok allar mótgerðir verri þykkja. Á því fann hann
  mikla muni, at hann var orðinn maðr svá myrkfælinn, at hann þorði hvergi
  at fara einn saman, þegar myrkva tók. Sýndiz honum þá hvers kyns skrípi;
  ok þat er haft síðan fyrir orðt&oelig;ki, at þeim ljái Glámr augna eðr
  gefi glámsýni, er mj&#x1EB;k sýniz annan veg, en er. Grettir reið heim
  til Bjargs, er hann hafði g&#x1EB;rt ørendi sín, ok sat heima um
  vetrinn.</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<i>b</i>) <i>Sandhaugar episode</i> (caps. 64-66)</p>

  <p>Steinn hét prestr, er bjó at Eyjardalsá í Bárðardal. Hann var búþegn
  góðr ok ríkr at fé. Kjartan hét son hans, r&#x1EB;skr maðr ok vel á legg
  kominn. Þorsteinn hvíti hét maðr, er <!-- Page 157 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page157"></a>{157}</span>bjó at Sandhaugum, suðr
  frá Eyjardalsá. Steinv&#x1EB;r hét kona hans, ung ok glaðlát. Þau áttu
  b&#x1EB;rn, ok váru þau ung í þenna tíma. Þar þótti m&#x1EB;nnum reimt
  mj&#x1EB;k sakir tr&#x1EB;llagangs. Þat bar til, tveim vetrum fyrr en
  Grettir kom norðr í sveitir, at Steinv&#x1EB;r húsfreyja at Sandhaugum
  fór til jólatíða til Eyjardalsár eptir vana, en bóndi var heima.
  L&#x1EB;gðuz menn niðr til svefns um kveldit; ok um nóttina heyrðu menn
  brak mikit í skálann, ok til sængr bónda. Engi þorði upp at standa at
  forvitnaz um, þvíat þar var fáment mj&#x1EB;k. Húsfreyja kom heim um
  morguninn, ok var bóndi horfinn, ok vissi engi, hvat af honum var orðit.
  Liðu svá hin næstu misseri. En annan vetr eptir, vildi húsfreyja fara til
  tíða; bað hon húskarl sinn heima vera. Hann var tregr til; en bað hana
  ráða. Fór þar allt á s&#x1EB;mu leið, sem fyrr, at húskarl var horfinn.
  Þetta þótti m&#x1EB;nnum undarligt. Sáu menn þá blóðdrefjar
  n&#x1EB;kkurar í útidyrum. Þóttuz menn þat vita, at óvættir mundu hafa
  tekit þá báða. Þetta fréttiz víða um sveitir. Grettir hafði spurn af
  þessu. Ok með því at honum var mj&#x1EB;k lagit at koma af reimleikum eða
  aptrg&#x1EB;ngum, þá gerði hann ferð sína til Bárðardals, ok kom
  atfangadag jóla til Sandha[u]ga. Hann duldiz ok nefndiz Gestr. Húsfreyja
  sá, at hann var furðu mikill vexti, en heimafólk var furðu hrætt við
  hann. Hann beiddiz þar gistingar. Húsfreyja kvað honum mat til reiðu, "en
  ábyrgz þik sjálfr."</p>

  <p>Hann kvað svá vera skyldu. "Mun ek vera heima," segir hann, "en þú far
  til tíða, ef þú vilt."</p>

  <p>Hon svarar: "Mér þykkir þú hraustr, ef þú þorir heima at vera."</p>

  <p>"Eigi læt ek mér at einu getit," sagði hann.</p>

  <p>"Illt þykkir mér heima at vera," segir hon, "en ekki komumz ek yfir
  ána."</p>

  <p>"Ek skal fylgja þér yfir," segir Gestr.</p>

  <p>Síðan bjóz hon til tiða, ok dóttir hennar með henni, lítil vexti.
  Hláka mikil var úti, ok áin í leysingum; var á henni jakaf&#x1EB;r.</p>

  <p>Þá mælti húsfreyja: "Óf&oelig;rt er yfir ána, bæði m&#x1EB;nnum ok
  hestum."</p>

  <p>"V&#x1EB;ð munu á vera," kvað Gestr; "ok verið eigi hræddar." <!--
  Page 158 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page158"></a>{158}</span></p>

  <p>"Ber þú fyrst meyna," kvað húsfreyja, "hon er léttari."</p>

  <p>"Ekki nenni ek at gera tvær ferðir at þessu," segir Gestr, "ok mun ek
  bera þik á handlegg mér."</p>

  <p>Hon signdi sik ok mælti: "Þetta er óf&oelig;ra; eða hvat gerir þú þá
  af meyjunni?"</p>

  <p>"Sjá mun ek ráð til þess," segir hann; ok greip þær upp báðar ok setti
  hina yngri í kné móður sinnar, ok bar þær svá á vinstra armlegg sér; en
  hafði lausa hina h&oelig;gri h&#x1EB;nd ok óð svá, út á vaðit. Eigi þorðu
  þær at &oelig;pa, svá váru þær hræddar. En áin skall þegar upp á brjósti
  honum. Þá rak at honum jaka mikinn; en hann skaut við hendi þeiri, er
  laus var, ok hratt frá sér. Gerði þá svá djúpt, at strauminn braut á
  &#x1EB;xlinni. Óð hann sterkliga, þar til er hann kom at bakkanum
  &#x1EB;ðrum megin, ok fleygir þeim á land. Síðan sneri hann aptr, ok var
  þá hálfrøkkvit, er hann kom heim til Sandhauga; ok kallaði til matar. Ok
  er hann var mettr, bað hann heimafólk fara innar í stofu. Hann tók þá
  borð ok lausa viðu, ok rak um þvera stofuna, ok gerði bálk mikinn, svá at
  engi heimamaðr komz fram yfir. Engi þorði í móti honum at mæla, ok í
  engum skyldi kretta. Gengit var í hliðvegginn stofunnar inn við
  gaflhlaðit; ok þar þverpallr hjá. Þar lagðiz Gestr niðr ok fór ekki af
  klæðunum. Ljós brann í stofunni gegnt dyrum. Liggr Gestr svá fram á
  nóttina.</p>

  <p>Húsfreyja kom til Eyjardalsár til tíða, ok undruðu menn um ferðir
  hennar yfir ána. Hon sagðiz eigi vita, hvárt hana hefði yfir flutt maðr
  eða tr&#x1EB;ll. Prestr kvað mann víst vera mundu, þóat fárra maki sé;
  "ok látum hljótt yfir," sagði hann; "má vera, at hann sé ætlaðr til at
  vinna bót á vandræðum þínum." Var húsfreyja þar um nóttina.</p>

  <p>Nú er frá Gretti þat at segja, at þá er dró at miðri nótt, heyrði hann
  út dynur miklar. Þvínæst kom inn í stofuna tr&#x1EB;llkona mikil. Hon
  hafði í hendi trog, en annarri skálm, heldr mikla. Hon litaz um, er hon
  kom inn, ok sá, hvar Gestr lá, ok hljóp at honum, en hann upp í móti, ok
  réðuz á grimmliga ok sóttuz lengi í stofunni. Hon var sterkari, en hann
  fór undan k&oelig;nliga. En allt þat, sem fyrir þeim varð, brutu þau,
  jafnvel þverþilit undan stofunni. Hon dró hann fram yfir dyrnar, ok svá í
  anddyrit; þar tók hann fast í móti. Hon <!-- Page 159 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page159"></a>{159}</span>vildi draga hann út ór
  b&oelig;num, en þat varð eigi fyrr en þau leystu frá allan
  útidyraumbúninginn ok báru hann út á herðum sér. Þ&oelig;fði hon þá ofan
  til árinnar ok allt fram at gljúfrum. Þá var Gestr ákafliga móðr, en þó
  varð annathvárt at gera: at herða sik, ella mundi hon steypa honum í
  gljúfrin. Alla nóttina sóttuz þau. Eigi þóttiz hann hafa fengiz við
  þvílíkan ófagnað fyrir afls sakir. Hon hafði haldit honum svá fast at
  sér, at hann mátti hvárigri hendi taka til n&#x1EB;kkurs, útan hann helt
  um hana miðja k[ett]una. Ok er þau kómu á árgljufrit, bregðr hann
  flagðkonunni til sveiflu. Í því varð honum laus hin h&oelig;gri
  h&#x1EB;ndin. Hann þreif þá skjótt til saxins, er hann var gyrðr með, ok
  bregðr því; høggr þá á &#x1EB;xl tr&#x1EB;llinu, svá at af tók
  h&#x1EB;ndina h&oelig;gri, ok svá, varð hann lauss. En hon steyptiz í
  gljúfrin ok svá í fossinn. Gestr var þá bæði stirðr ok móðr, ok lá þar
  lengi á hamrinum. Gekk hann þá heim, er lýsa tók, ok lagðiz í rekkju.
  Hann var allr þrútinn ok blár.</p>

  <p>Ok er húsfreyja kom frá tíðum, þótti henni heldr raskat um hýbýli sín.
  Gekk hon þá til Gests ok spurði, hvat til hefði borit, er allt var brotit
  ok b&oelig;lt. Hann sagði allt, sem farit hafði. Henni þótti mikils um
  vert, ok spurði, hverr hann var. Hann sagði þá til hit sanna, ok bað
  s&oelig;kja prest ok kvaz vildu finna hann. Var ok svá g&#x1EB;rt. En er
  Steinn prestr kom til Sandhauga, varð hann brátt þess víss, at þar var
  kominn Grettir Ásmundarson, er Gestr nefndiz. Prestr spurði, hvat hann
  ætlaði af þeim m&#x1EB;nnum mundi vera orðit, er þar h&#x1EB;fðu horfit.
  Grettir kvaz ætla, at í gljúfrin mundu þeir hafa horfit. Prestr kvaz eigi
  kunna at leggja trúnað á sagnir hans, ef engi merki mætti til sjá.
  Grettir segir, at sífðar vissi þeir þat gørr. Fór prestr heim. Grettir lá
  í rekkju margar nætr. Húsfreyja gerði við hann harðla vel; ok leið svá af
  jólin. Þetta er s&#x1EB;gn Grettis, at tr&#x1EB;llkonan steypðiz í
  gljúfrin við, er hon fekk sárit; en Bárðardalsmenn segja, at hana dagaði
  uppi, þá er þau glímdu, ok spryngi, þá er hann hjó af henni
  h&#x1EB;ndina, ok standi þar enn í konu líking á bjarginu. Þeir
  dalbúarnir leyndu þar Gretti.</p>

  <p>Um vetrinn eptir jól var þat einn dag, at Grettir fór til Eyjardalsár.
  Ok er þeir Grettir funduz ok prestr, mælti Grettir: "Sé ek þat, prestr,"
  segir hann, "at þú leggr lítinn <!-- Page 160 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page160"></a>{160}</span>trúnað á sagnir mínar. Nú vil ek at þú
  farir með mér til árinnar, ok sjáir, hver líkendi þér þykkir á vera."</p>

  <p>Prestr gerði svá. En er þeir kómu til fossins, sáu þeir skúta upp
  undir bergit; þat var meitilberg svá mikit, at hvergi mátti upp komaz, ok
  nær tíu faðma ofan at vatninu. Þeir h&#x1EB;fðu festi með sér.</p>

  <p>Þá mælti prestr: "Langt um óf&oelig;rt sýniz mér þér niðr at
  fara."</p>

  <p>Grettir svarar: "F&oelig;rt er víst; en þeim mun bezt þar, sem
  ágætismenn eru. Mun ek forvitnaz, hvat í fossinum er, en þú skalt geyma
  festar."</p>

  <p>Prestr bað hann ráða, ok keyrði niðr hæl á berginu, ok bar at grjót,
  [ok sat þar hjá].</p>

  <p>Nú er frá Gretti at segja, at hann lét stein í festaraugat ok lét svá
  síga ofan at vatninu.</p>

  <p>"Hvern veg ætlar þú nú," segir prestr, "at fara?"</p>

  <p>"Ekki vil ek vera bundinn," segir Grettir, "þá er ek kem í fossinn;
  svá boðar mér hugr um."</p>

  <p>Eptir þat bjó hann sik til ferðar, ok var fáklæddr, ok gyrði sik með
  saxinu, en hafði ekki fleiri vápn. Síðan hljóp hann af bjarginu ok niðr í
  fossinn. Sá prestr í iljar honum, ok vissi síðan aldri, hvat af honum
  varð. Grettir kafaði undir fossinn, ok var þat torvelt, þvíat iða var
  mikil, ok varð hann allt til grunns at kafa, áðr en hann k&oelig;miz upp
  undir fossinn. Þar var forberg n&#x1EB;kkut, ok komz hann inn þar upp á.
  Þar var hellir mikill undir fossinum, ok fell áin fram af berginu. Gekk
  hann þá inn í hellinn, ok var þar eldr mikill á br&#x1EB;ndum. Grettir
  sá, at þar sat j&#x1EB;tunn &#x1EB;gurliga mikill; hann var hræðiligr at
  sjá. En er Grettir kom at honum, hljóp j&#x1EB;tunninn upp ok greip flein
  einn ok hjó til þess, er kominn var, þvíat bæði mátti h&#x1EB;ggva ok
  leggja með [honum]. Tréskapt var í; þat k&#x1EB;lluðu menn þá heptisax,
  er þannveg var g&#x1EB;rt. Grettir hjó á móti með saxinu, ok kom á
  skaptit, svá at í sundr tók. J&#x1EB;tunninn vildi þá seilaz á bak sér
  aptr til sverðs, er þar hekk í hellinum. Í því hjó Grettir framan á
  brjóstit, svá at náliga tók af alla bringspelina ok kviðinn, svá at iðrin
  steyptuz ór honum ofan í ána, ok keyrði þau ofan eptir ánni. Ok er prestr
  sat við festina, sá hann, at slyðrur n&#x1EB;kkurar rak ofan eptir
  strengnum blóðugar <!-- Page 161 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page161"></a>{161}</span>allar. Hann varð þá lauss á velli, ok
  þóttiz nú vita, at Grettir mundi dauðr vera. Hljóp hann þá frá
  festarhaldinu ok fór heim. Var þá komit at kveldi, ok sagði prestr
  vísliga, at Grettir væri dauðr; ok sagði, at mikill skaði væri eptir
  þvílíkan mann.</p>

  <p>Nú er frá Gretti at segja; hann lét skamt h&#x1EB;ggva í milli, þar
  til er j&#x1EB;tunninn dó. Gekk Grettir þá innar eptir hellinum. Hann
  kveikti ljós ok kannaði hellinn. Ekki er frá því sagt, hversu mikit fé
  hann fekk í hellinum; en þat ætla menn, at verit hafi n&#x1EB;kkut.
  Dvaldiz honum þar fram á nóttina. Hann fann þar tveggja manna bein, ok
  bar þau í belg einn. Leitaði hann þá ór hellinum ok lagðiz til
  festarinnar, ok hristi hana, ok ætlaði, at prestr mundi þar vera. En er
  hann vissi, at prestr var heim farinn, varð hann þá at handstyrkja upp
  festina, ok komz hann svá upp á bjargit. Fór hann þá heim til Eyjardalsár
  ok kom í forkirkju belginum þeim, sem beinin váru í, ok þar með rúnakefli
  því, er vísur þessar váru forkunnliga vel á ristnar:</p>

  <p>Þar sagði svá, at Grettir hafi bein þessi ór hellinum haft. En er
  prestr kom til kirkju um morgininn, fann hann keflit ok þat sem fylgdi,
  ok las rúnarnar. En Grettir hafði farit heim til Sandhauga.</p>

  <p>En þá er prestr fann Gretti, spurði hann inniliga eptir atburðum; en
  hann sagði alla s&#x1EB;gu um ferð sína, ok kvað prest ótrúliga hafa

  óvættir mundu valdit hafa mannahv&#x1EB;rfum þar í dalnum. Varð ok aldri

  þar g&#x1EB;rt hafa mikla landhreinsan. Prestr jarðaði bein þessi í
  kirkjugarði.</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<i>a</i>) <i>Glam episode</i> (p. <a href="#page146">146</a> above)</p>

  <p>There was a man called Thorhall, who lived at Thorhall's Farm in
  Shadow-dale. Shadow-dale runs up from Water-dale. Thorhall was son of
  Grim, son of Thorhall, son of Frithmund, who settled Shadow-dale.
  Thorhall's wife was called Guthrun: their son was Grim, and Thurith their
  daughter&mdash;they were grown up.</p>

<div class="sidenotel">p. <a href="#page147">147</a></div>
  <p>Thorhall was a wealthy man, and especially in cattle, so that no man
  had as much live stock as he. He was not a chief, yet a substantial
  yeoman. The place was much haunted, and he found it hard to get a
  shepherd to suit him. He sought counsel of many wise men, what device he
  should follow, but he got no counsel which was of use to him. Thorhall
  rode each summer to the All-Thing; he had good horses. That was one
  summer at the All-Thing, that Thorhall went to the booth of Skapti
  Thoroddsson, the Law-man.</p>

  <p>Skapti was the wisest of men, and gave good advice if he was asked.
  There was this difference between Skapti and his father Thorodd: Thorodd
  had second sight, and some men called him underhanded; but Skapti gave to
  every man that advice which he believed would avail, if it were kept to:
  so he was called 'Better than his father.' Thorhall went to the booth of
  Skapti. Skapti greeted Thorhall well, for he knew that he was a
  prosperous man, and asked what news he had.</p>

  <p>Thorhall said, "I should like good counsel from thee." "I am little
  use at that," said Skapti. "But what is thy need?" <!-- Page 164 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page164"></a>{164}</span></p>

  <p>Thorhall said, "It happens so, that it is difficult for me to keep my
  shepherds: they easily get hurt, and some will not serve their time. And
  now no one will take on the task, who knows what is before him."</p>

  <p>Skapti answered, "There must be some evil being about, if men are more
  unwilling to look after thy sheep than those of other folk. Now because
  thou hast sought counsel of me, I will find thee a shepherd, who is named
  Glam, a Swede, from Sylgsdale, who came out to Iceland last summer. He is
  great and strong, but not much to everybody's taste."</p>

  <p>Thorhall said that he would not mind that, if he guarded the sheep
  well. Skapti said that if Glam had not the strength and courage to do
  that, there was no hope of anyone else. Then Thorhall went out; this was
  when the All-Thing was nearly ending.</p>

  <p>Thorhall missed two light bay horses, and he went himself to look for
  them&mdash;so it seems that he was not a great man. He went up under
  Sledge-hill and south along the mountain called Armannsfell.</p>

  <p>Then he saw where a man came down from Gothashaw, bearing faggots on a
  horse. They soon met, and Thorhall asked him his name, and he said he was
  called Glam. Glam <span class="sidenotel">p. <a
  href="#page148">148</a></span> was tall and strange in bearing, with
  blue<a name="NtA299" href="#Nt299"><sup>[299]</sup></a> and glaring eyes,
  and wolf-grey hair. Thorhall opened his eyes when he saw him, but yet he
  discerned that this was he to whom he had been sent.</p>

  <p>"What work art thou best fitted for?" said Thorhall.</p>

  <p>Glam said he was well fitted to watch sheep in the winter.</p>

  <p>"Wilt thou watch my sheep?" said Thorhall. "Skapti gave thee into my
  hand."</p>

  <p>"You will have least trouble with me in your house if I go my own way,
  for I am hard of temper if I am not pleased," said Glam.</p>

  <p>"That will not matter to me," said Thorhall, "and I wish that thou
  shouldst go to my house."</p>

  <p>"That may I well do," said Glam, "but are there any difficulties?"</p>

<p><!-- Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165"></a>{165}</span></p>

  <p>"It is thought to be haunted," said Thorhall.</p>

  <p>"I am not afraid of such phantoms," said Glam, "and it seems to me all
  the less dull."</p>

  <p>"Thou wilt need such a spirit," said Thorhall, "and it is better that
  the man there should not be a coward."</p>

  <p>After that they struck their bargain, and Glam was to come at the
  winter-nights [14th-16th of October]. Then they parted, and Thorhall
  found his horses where he had just been searching. Thorhall rode home and
  thanked Skapti for his good deed.</p>

  <p>Summer passed, and Thorhall heard nothing of his shepherd, and no one
  knew anything of him; but at the time appointed he came to Thorhall's
  Farm. The yeoman greeted him well, but all the others could not abide
  him, and Thorhall's wife least of all. Glam undertook the watching of the
  sheep, and it gave him little trouble. He had a great deep voice, and the
  sheep came together as soon as he called them. There was a church at
  Thorhall's Farm, but Glam would not go to it. He would have nothing to do
  with the service, and was godless; he was obstinate and surly and
  abhorred by all.</p>

  <p>Now time went on till it came to Yule eve. Then Glam rose early and
  called for meat. The yeoman's wife answered, "That is not the custom of
  Christian men to eat meat today, because tomorrow is the first day of
  Yule," said she, "and therefore it is right that we should first fast
  today."</p>

  <p>He answered, "Ye have many superstitions which I see are good for
  nothing. I do not know that men fare better now <span
  class="sidenotel">p. <a href="#page149">149</a></span> than before, when
  they had nought to do with such things. It seemed to me a better way when
  men were called heathen; and I want my meat and no tricks."</p>

  <p>The yeoman's wife said, "I know for a certainty that it will fare ill
  with thee today, if thou dost this evil thing."</p>

  <p>Glam bade her bring the meat at once, else he said it should be worse
  for her. She dared not do otherwise than he willed, and when he had eaten
  he went out, foul-mouthed.</p>

  <p>Now it had gone so with the weather that it was heavy all round, and
  snow-flakes were falling, and it was blowing loud, and grew much worse as
  the day went on. The shepherd <!-- Page 166 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page166"></a>{166}</span>was heard early in the day, but less
  later. Then wind began to drive the snow, and towards evening it became a
  tempest. Then men came to the service, and so it went on to nightfall.
  Glam did not come home. Then there was talk whether search ought not to
  be made for him, but because there was a tempest and it was pitch dark,
  no search was attempted. That Yule night he did not come home, and so men
  waited till after the service [next, i.e. Christmas, morning]. But when
  it was full day, men went to search, and found the sheep scattered in the
  snow-drifts<a name="NtA300" href="#Nt300"><sup>[300]</sup></a>, battered
  by the tempest, or strayed up into the mountains. Then they came on a
  great space beaten down, high up in the valley. It looked to them as if
  there had been somewhat violent wrestling there, because the stones had
  been torn up for a distance around, and the earth likewise. They looked
  closely and saw where Glam lay a little distance away. He was dead, and
  blue like Hel and swollen like an ox. They had great loathing of him, and
  their souls shuddered at him. Nevertheless they strove to bring him to
  the church, but they could get him no further than the edge of a ravine a
  little below, and they went home leaving matters so, and told the yeoman
  what had happened. He asked what appeared to have been the death of Glam.
  They said that, from the trodden spot, up to a place beneath the rocks
  high in the valley, they had tracked marks as big as if a cask-bottom had
  been stamped down, and great drops of blood with them. So men concluded
  from this, that the evil thing which had been there before must have
  killed Glam, but Glam must have done it damage which had been enough, in
  that nought has ever happened since from that evil thing.</p>

  <p>The second day of Yule it was again essayed to bring Glam to the
  church.</p>

  <p>Beasts of draught were harnessed, but they could not move him where it
  was level ground and not down hill, so they departed, leaving matters
  so.</p>

  <p>The third day the priest went with them, and they searched <span
  class="sidenotel">p. <a href="#page150">150</a></span> all day, but Glam
  could not be found. The priest would go no <!-- Page 167 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page167"></a>{167}</span>more, but Glam was
  found when the priest was not in the company. Then they gave up trying to
  carry him to the church, and buried him where he was, under a cairn.</p>

  <p>A little later men became aware that Glam was not lying quiet. Great
  harm came to men from this, so that many fell into a swoon when they saw
  him, and some could not keep their wits. Just after Yule, men thought
  they saw him at home at the farm. They were exceedingly afraid, and many
  fled away. Thereupon Glam took to riding the house-roofs at nights, so
  that he nearly broke them in. He walked almost night and day. Men hardly
  dared to go up into the dale, even though they had business enough. Men
  in that country-side thought great harm of this.</p>

  <p>In the spring Thorhall got farm-hands together and set up house on his
  land. Then the apparition began to grow less frequent whilst the sun's
  course was at its height; and so it went on till midsummer. That summer a
  ship came out to Hunawater. On it was a man called Thorgaut. He was an
  outlander by race, big and powerful; he had the strength of two men. He
  was in no man's service, and alone, and he wished to take up some work,
  since he had no money. Thorhall rode to the ship, and met Thorgaut. He
  asked him if he would work for him. Thorgaut said that might well be, and
  that he would make no difficulties.</p>

  <p>"But thou must be prepared," said Thorhall, "that it is no place for
  weaklings, by reason of the hauntings which have been going on for a
  while, for I will not let thee into a trap."</p>

  <p>Thorgaut answered, "It does not seem to me that I am undone, even
  though I were to see some little ghosts. It must be no easy matter for
  others if I am frightened, and I will not give up my place for that."</p>

  <p>So now they agreed well, and Thorgaut was to watch the sheep when
  winter came.</p>

  <p>Now the summer passed on. Thorgaut took charge of the sheep at the
  winter-nights. He was well-pleasing to all. Glam ever came home and rode
  on the roofs. Thorgaut thought it sporting, and said that the thrall
  would have to come nearer <!-- Page 168 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page168"></a>{168}</span>in order to scare him. But Thorhall bade
  him keep quiet: "It is best that ye should not try your strength
  together." Thorgaut said, "Verily, your courage is shaken out of you: I
  shall not drop down with fear between day and night over such talk."</p>

  <p>Now things went on through the winter up to Yule-tide. On Yule evening
  the shepherd went out to his sheep. Then <span class="sidenotel">p. <a
  href="#page151">151</a></span> the yeoman's wife said, "It is to be hoped
  that now things will not go in the old way."</p>

  <p>He answered, "Be not afraid of that, mistress; something worth telling
  will have happened if I do not come back."</p>

  <p>Then he went to his sheep. The weather was cold, and it snowed much.
  Thorgaut was wont to come home when it was twilight, but now he did not
  come at that time. Men came to the service, as was the custom. It seemed
  to people that things were going as they had before. The yeoman wished to
  have search made for the shepherd, but the church-goers excused
  themselves, and said they would not risk themselves out in the hands of
  the trolls by night. And the yeoman did not dare to go, so the search
  came to nothing.</p>

  <p>On Yule-day, when men had eaten, they went and searched for the
  shepherd. They went first to Glam's cairn, because men thought that the
  shepherd's disappearance must have been through his bringing-about. But
  when they came near the cairn they saw great things, for there they found
  the shepherd with his neck broken and not a bone in him whole. Then they
  carried him to the church, and no harm happened to any man from Thorgaut
  afterwards; but Glam began to increase in strength anew. He did so much
  that all men fled away from Thorhall's Farm, except only the yeoman and
  his wife.</p>

  <p>Now the same cattle-herd had been there a long time. Thorhall would
  not let him go, because of his good-will and good service. He was far
  gone in age and was very unwilling to leave: he saw that everything went
  to waste which the yeoman had, if no one looked after it. And once after
  mid-winter it happened one morning that the yeoman's wife went to the
  byre to milk the cows as usual. It was quite light, because no one dared
  to go out before, except the cattle-herd: he went <!-- Page 169 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page169"></a>{169}</span>out as soon as it
  dawned. She heard great cracking in the byre and a hideous bellowing. She
  ran back, crying out, and said she did not know what devilry was going on
  in the byre.</p>

  <p>The yeoman went out, and came to the cattle, and they were goring each
  other. It seemed to him no good to stay there, and he went further into
  the hay-barn. He saw where the cattle-herd lay, and he had his head in
  one stall and his feet in the next. He lay on his back. The yeoman went
  to him and felt him. He soon found that he was dead, and his back-bone
  broken in two; it had been broken over the partition slab.</p>

  <p>Now it seemed no longer bearable to Thorhall, and he left his farm
  with all that he could carry away; but all the live-stock <span
  class="sidenotel">p. <a href="#page152">152</a></span> left behind Glam
  killed. After that he went through all the dale and laid waste all the
  farms up from Tongue. Thorhall spent what was left of the winter with his
  friends. No man could go up into the dale with horse or hound, because it
  was slain forthwith. But when spring came, and the course of the sun was
  highest, the apparitions abated somewhat. Now Thorhall wished to go back
  to his land. It was not easy for him to get servants, but still he set up
  house at Thorhall's Farm.</p>

  <p>All went the same way as before. When autumn came on the hauntings
  began to increase. The yeoman's daughter was most attacked, and it fared
  so that she died. Many counsels were taken, but nothing was done. Things
  seemed to men to be looking as if all Water-dale must be laid waste,
  unless some remedies could be found.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Now the story must be taken up about Grettir, how he sat at home at
  Bjarg that autumn, after he had parted from Barthi-of-the-Slayings at
  Thorey's Peak. And when it had almost come to the winter-nights, Grettir
  rode from home, north over the neck to Willow-dale, and was a guest at
  Authun's Farm. He was fully reconciled to Authun, and gave him a good
  axe, and they spake of their wish for friendship one with the other.
  (Authun dwelt long at Authun's Farm, and much goodly offspring had he.
  Egil was his son, who wedded Ulfheith, daughter of Eyjolf Guthmundson;
  and their son was Eyjolf, who was slain at the All-Thing. He was father
  of Orm, chaplain to <!-- Page 170 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page170"></a>{170}</span>Bishop Thorlak.) Grettir rode north to
  Water-dale and came on a visit to Tongue. At that time Jokul Barthson
  lived there, Grettir's uncle. Jokul was a man great and strong and very
  proud. He was a seafaring man, and very over-bearing, yet of great
  account. He received Grettir well, and Grettir was there three
  nights.</p>

  <p>There was so much said about the apparitions of Glam that nothing was
  spoken of by men equally with that. Grettir inquired exactly about the
  events which had happened. Jokul said that nothing more had been spoken
  than had verily occurred. "But art thou anxious, kinsman, to go
  there?"</p>

  <p>Grettir said that that was the truth. Jokul begged him not to do so,
  "For that is a great risk of thy luck, and thy kinsmen have much at stake
  where thou art," said he, "for none of the young men seems to us to be
  equal to thee; but ill will come of ill where Glam is, and it is much
  better to have to do with mortal men than with evil creatures like
  that."</p>

  <p>Grettir said he was minded to go to Thorhall's Farm and <span
  class="sidenotel">p. <a href="#page153">153</a></span> see how things had
  fared there. Jokul said, "I see now that it is of no avail to stop thee,
  but true it is what men say, that good-luck is one thing, and goodliness
  another."</p>

  <p>"Woe is before one man's door when it is come into another's house.
  Think how it may fare with thee thyself before the end," said
  Grettir.</p>

  <p>Jokul answered, "It may be that both of us can see somewhat into the
  future, but neither can do aught in the matter."</p>

  <p>After that they parted, and neither was pleased with the other's
  foreboding.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Grettir rode to Thorhall's Farm, and the yeoman greeted him well. He
  asked whither Grettir meant to go, but Grettir said he would stay there
  over the night if the yeoman would have it so. Thorhall said he owed him
  thanks for being there, "But few men find it a profit to stay here for
  any time. Thou must have heard what the dealings are here, and I would
  fain that thou shouldst have no troubles on my account; but though thou
  shouldst come whole away, I know for certain that thou <!-- Page 171
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page171"></a>{171}</span>wilt lose thy
  steed, for no one who comes here keeps his horse whole."</p>

  <p>Grettir said there were plenty of horses, whatever should become of
  this one.</p>

  <p>Thorhall was glad that Grettir would stay there, and welcomed him
  exceedingly.</p>

  <p>Grettir's horse was strongly locked in an out-house. They went to
  sleep, and so the night passed without Glam coming home. Then Thorhall
  said, "Things have taken a good turn against thy coming, for every night
  Glam has been wont to ride the roofs or break up the doors, even as thou
  canst see."</p>

  <p>Grettir said, "Then must one of two things happen. Either he will not
  long hold himself in, or the wonted haunting will cease for more than one
  night. I will stay here another night and see how it goes."</p>

  <p>Then they went to Grettir's horse, and he had not been attacked. Then
  everything seemed to the yeoman to be going one way. Now Grettir stayed
  for another night, and the thrall did not come home. Then things seemed
  to the yeoman to be taking a very hopeful turn. He went to look after
  Grettir's horse. When he came there, the stable was broken into, and the
  horse dragged out to the door, and every bone in him broken asunder.</p>

  <p>Thorhall told Grettir what had happened, and bade him save his own
  life&mdash;"For thy death is sure if thou waitest for Glam."</p>

  <p>Grettir answered, "The least I must have in exchange for my horse is
  to see the thrall."</p>

  <p>The yeoman said that there was no good in seeing him: <span
  class="sidenotel">p. <a href="#page154">154</a></span> "For he is unlike
  any shape of man; but every hour that thou wilt stay here seems good to
  me."</p>

  <p>Now the day went on, and when bed-time came Grettir would not put off
  his clothes, but lay down in the seat over against the yeoman's
  sleeping-chamber. He had a shaggy cloak over him, and wrapped one corner
  of it down under his feet, and twisted the other under his head and
  looked out through the head-opening. There was a great and strong
  partition beam in front of the seat, and he put his feet against it. The
  <!-- Page 172 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page172"></a>{172}</span>doorframe was all broken away from the
  outer door, but now boards, fastened together carelessly anyhow, had been
  tied in front. The panelling which had been in front was all broken away
  from the hall, both above and below the cross-beam; the beds were all
  torn out of their places, and everything was very wretched<a
  name="NtA301" href="#Nt301"><sup>[301]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>A light burned in the hall during the night: and when a third part of
  the night was past, Grettir heard a great noise outside. Some creature
  had mounted upon the buildings and was riding upon the hall and beating
  it with its heels, so that it cracked in every rafter. This went on a
  long time. Then the creature came down from the buildings and went to the
  door. When the door was opened Grettir saw that the thrall had stretched
  in his head, and it seemed to him monstrously great and wonderfully huge.
  Glam went slowly and stretched himself up when he came inside the door.
  He towered up to the roof. He turned and laid his arm upon the cross-beam
  and glared in upon the hall. The yeoman did not let himself be heard,
  because the noise he heard outside seemed to him enough. Grettir lay
  quiet and did not move.</p>

  <p>Glam saw that a heap lay upon the seat, and he stalked in up the hall
  and gripped the cloak wondrous fast. Grettir pressed his feet against the
  post and gave not at all. Glam pulled a second time much more violently,
  and the cloak did not move. A third time he gripped with both hands so
  mightily that he pulled Grettir up from the seat, and now the cloak was
  torn asunder between them.</p>

  <p>Glam gazed at the portion which he held, and wondered much who could
  have pulled so hard against him; and at that moment Grettir leapt under
  his arms and grasped him round <!-- Page 173 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page173"></a>{173}</span>the middle, and bent his back as mightily
  as he could, reckoning that Glam would sink to his knees at his attack.
  But the thrall laid such a grip on Grettir's arm that he recoiled at the
  might of it. Then Grettir gave way from one seat to another. The beams<a
  name="NtA302" href="#Nt302"><sup>[302]</sup></a> started, and all that
  came in their way was broken. <span class="sidenotel">p. <a
  href="#page155">155</a></span> Glam wished to get out, but Grettir set
  his feet against any support he could find; nevertheless Glam dragged him
  forward out of the hall. And there they had a sore wrestling, in that the
  thrall meant to drag him right out of the building; but ill as it was to
  have to do with Glam inside, Grettir saw that it would be yet worse
  without, and so he struggled with all his might against going out. Glam
  put forth all his strength, and dragged Grettir towards himself when they
  came to the porch. And when Grettir saw that he could not resist, then
  all at once he flung himself against the breast of the thrall, as
  powerfully as he could, and pressed forward with both his feet against a
  stone which stood fast in the earth at the entrance. The thrall was not
  ready for this, he had been pulling to drag Grettir towards himself; and
  thereupon he stumbled on his back out of doors, so that his shoulders
  smote against the cross-piece of the door, and the roof clave asunder,
  both wood and frozen thatch. So Glam fell backwards out of the house and
  Grettir on top of him. There was bright moonshine and broken clouds
  without. At times they drifted in front of the moon and at times away.
  Now at the moment when Glam fell, the clouds cleared from before the
  moon, and Glam rolled up his eyes; and Grettir himself has said that that
  was the one sight he had seen which struck fear into him. Then such a
  sinking came over Grettir, from his weariness and from that sight of Glam
  rolling his eyes, that he had no strength to draw his knife and lay
  almost between life and death.</p>

<p><!-- Page 174 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page174"></a>{174}</span></p>

  <p>But in this was there more power for evil in Glam than in most other
  apparitions, in that he spake thus: "Much eagerness hast thou shown,
  Grettir," said he, "to meet with me. But no wonder will it seem if thou
  hast no good luck from me. And this can I tell thee, that thou hast now
  achieved one half of the power and might which was fated for thee if thou
  hadst not met with me. Now no power have I to take that might from thee
  to which thou hast attained. But in this may I have my way, that thou
  shalt never become stronger than now thou art, and yet art thou strong
  enough, as many a one shall find to his cost. Famous hast thou been till
  now for thy deeds, but from now on shall exiles and manslaughters fall to
  thy lot, and almost all of thy labours shall turn to ill-luck and
  unhappiness. Thou shalt be outlawed and doomed ever to dwell alone, away
  from men; and then lay I this fate on thee, that these eyes of mine be
  ever before thy sight, and it shall seem grievous unto thee to be alone,
  and that shall drag thee to thy death."</p>

  <p>And when the thrall had said this, the swoon which had <span
  class="sidenotel">p. <a href="#page156">156</a></span> fallen upon
  Grettir passed from him. Then he drew his sword and smote off Glam's
  head, and placed it by his thigh.</p>

  <p>Then the yeoman came out: he had clad himself whilst Glam was uttering
  his curse, but he dare in no wise come near before Glam had fallen.
  Thorhall praised God for it, and thanked Grettir well for having
  vanquished the unclean spirit.</p>

  <p>Then they set to work and burned Glam to cold cinders. After, they put
  the ashes in a skin-bag and buried them as far as possible from the ways
  of man or beast. After that they went home, and by that time it was well
  on to day. Grettir lay down, for he was very stiff. Thorhall sent people
  to the next farm for men, and showed to them what had happened. To all
  those who heard of it, it seemed a work of great account; and that was
  then spoken by all, that no man in all the land was equal to Grettir
  Asmundarson for might and valour and all prowess. Thorhall sent Grettir
  from his house with honour, and gave him a good horse and fit clothing;
  for all the clothes which he had worn before were torn asunder. They
  parted great friends. Grettir rode thence to Ridge in Water-dale, and
  Thorvald greeted him well, and asked closely as to his meeting <!-- Page
  175 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page175"></a>{175}</span>with Glam.
  Grettir told him of their dealings, and said that never had he had such a
  trial of strength, so long a struggle had theirs been together.</p>

  <p>Thorvald bade him keep quiet, "and then all will be well, otherwise
  there are bound to be troubles for thee."</p>

  <p>Grettir said that his temper had not bettered, and that he was now
  more unruly than before, and all offences seemed worse to him. And in
  that he found a great difference, that he had become so afraid of the
  dark that he did not dare to go anywhere alone after night had fallen.
  All kinds of horrors appeared to him then. And that has since passed into
  a proverb, that Glam gives eyes, or gives "glam-sight" to those to whom
  things seem quite other than they are. Grettir rode home to Bjarg when he
  had done his errand, and remained at home during the winter.</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<i>b</i>) <i>Sandhaugar episode</i> (p. <a href="#page156">156</a> above)</p>

  <p>There was a priest called Stein who lived at Eyjardalsá (Isledale
  River) in Barthardal. He was a good husbandman and rich in cattle. His
  son was Kjartan, a doughty man and well grown. There was a man called
  Thorstein the White who <span class="sidenotel">p. <a
  href="#page157">157</a></span> lived at Sandhaugar (Sandheaps), south of
  Isledale river; his wife was called Steinvor, and she was young and
  merry. They had children, who were young then.</p>

  <p>People thought the place was much haunted by reason of the visitation
  of trolls. It happened, two winters before Grettir came North into those
  districts, that the good-wife Steinvor at Sandhaugar went to a Christmas
  service, according to her custom, at Isledale river, but her husband
  remained at home. In the evening men went to bed, and during the night
  they heard a great rummage in the hall, and by the good-man's bed. No one
  dared to get up to look to it, because there were very few men about. The
  good-wife came home in the morning, but her husband had vanished, and no
  one knew what had become of him.</p>

  <p>The next year passed away. But the winter after, the good-wife wished
  again to go to the church-service, and she bade her <!-- Page 176
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page176"></a>{176}</span>manservant
  remain at home. He was unwilling, but said she must have her own way. All
  went in the same manner as before, and the servant vanished. People
  thought that strange. They saw some splashes of blood on the outer door,
  and men thought that evil beings must have taken away both the good-man
  and the servant.</p>

  <p>The news of this spread wide throughout the country. Grettir heard of
  it; and because it was his fortune to get rid of hauntings and
  spirit-walkings, he took his way to Barthardal, and came to Sandhaugar on
  Yule eve. He disguised himself<a name="NtA303"
  href="#Nt303"><sup>[303]</sup></a>, and said his name was Guest. The
  good-wife saw that he was great of stature; and the farm-folk were much
  afraid of him. He asked for quarters for the night. The good-wife said
  that he could have meat forthwith, but "You must look after your own
  safety."</p>

  <p>He said it should be so. "I will be at home," said he, "and you can go
  to the service if you will."</p>

  <p>She answered, "You are a brave man, it seems to me, if you dare to
  remain at home."</p>

  <p>"I do not care to have things all one way<a name="NtA304"
  href="#Nt304"><sup>[304]</sup></a>," said he.</p>

  <p>"It seems ill to me to be at home," said she, "but I cannot get over
  the river."</p>

  <p>"I will see you over," said Guest.</p>

  <p>Then she got ready to go to the service, and her small daughter with
  her. It was thawing, the river was in flood, and there were ice-floes in
  it. Then the good-wife said, "It is impossible for man or horse to get
  across the river."</p>

  <p>"There must be fords in it," said Guest, "do not be afraid."</p>

<div class="sidenotel">p. <a href="#page158">158</a></div>
  <p>"Do you carry the child first," said the good-wife, "she is the
  lighter."</p>

  <p>"I do not care to make two journeys of it," said Guest, "and I will
  carry thee on my arm."</p>

  <p>She crossed herself and said, "That is an impossible way; what will
  you do with the child?"</p>

<p><!-- Page 177 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page177"></a>{177}</span></p>

  <p>"I will see a way for that," said he; and then he took them both up,
  and set the child on her mother's knee and so bore them both on his left
  arm. But he had his right hand free, and thus he waded out into the
  ford.</p>

  <p>They did not dare to cry out, so much afraid were they. The river
  washed at once up against his breast; then it tossed a great icefloe
  against him, but he put out the hand that was free and pushed it from
  him. Then it grew so deep that the river dashed over his shoulder; but he
  waded stoutly on, until he came to the bank on the other side, and threw
  Steinvor and her daughter on the land.</p>

  <p>Then he turned back, and it was half dark when he came to Sandhaugar
  and called for meat; and when he had eaten, he bade the farm folk go to
  the far side of the room. Then he took boards and loose timber which he
  dragged across the room, and made a great barrier so that none of the
  farm folk could come over it. No one dared to say anything against him or
  to murmur in any wise. The entrance was in the side wall of the chamber
  by the gable-end, and there was a dais there. Guest lay down there, but
  did not take off his clothes: a light was burning in the room over
  against the door: Guest lay there far into the night.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The good-wife came to Isledale river to the service, and men wondered
  how she had crossed the river. She said she did not know whether it was a
  man or a troll who had carried her over. The priest said, "It must surely
  be a man, although there are few like him. And let us say nothing about
  it," said he, "it may be that he is destined to work a remedy for your
  evils." The good-wife remained there through the night.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Now it is to be told concerning Grettir that when it drew towards
  midnight he heard great noises outside. Thereupon there came into the
  room a great giantess. She had in one hand a trough and in the other a
  short-sword, rather a big one. She looked round when she came in, and saw
  where Guest lay, and sprang at him; but he sprang up against her, and
  they struggled fiercely and wrestled for a long time in the room. She was
  the <!-- Page 178 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page178"></a>{178}</span>stronger, but he gave way warily; and they
  broke all that was before them, as well as the panelling of the room. She
  dragged him forward through the door and so<a name="NtA305"
  href="#Nt305"><sup>[305]</sup></a> into the porch, and he <span
  class="sidenotel">p. <a href="#page159">159</a></span> struggled hard
  against her. She wished to drag him out of the house, but that did not
  happen until they had broken all the fittings of the outer doorway and
  forced them out on their shoulders. Then she dragged him slowly down
  towards the river and right along to the gorge.</p>

  <p>By that time Guest was exceedingly weary, but yet, one or other it had
  to be, either he had to gather his strength together, or else she would
  have hurled him down into the gorge. All night they struggled. He thought
  that he had never grappled with such a devil in the matter of strength.
  She had got such a grip upon him that he could do nothing with either
  hand, except to hold the witch by the middle; but when they came to the
  gorge of the river he swung the giantess round, and thereupon got his
  right hand free. Then quickly he gripped his knife that he wore in his
  girdle and drew it, and smote the shoulder of the giantess so that he cut
  off her right arm. So he got free: but she fell into the gorge, and so
  into the rapids below.</p>

  <p>Guest was then both stiff and tired, and lay long on the rocks; then
  he went home when it began to grow light, and lay down in bed. He was all
  swollen black and blue.</p>

  <p>And when the good-wife came from the service, it seemed to her that
  things had been somewhat disarranged in her house. Then she went to Guest
  and asked him what had happened, that all was broken and destroyed<a
  name="NtA306" href="#Nt306"><sup>[306]</sup></a>. He told her all that
  had taken place. She thought it very wonderful, and asked who he was. He
  told her the truth, and asked her to send for the priest, and said he
  wished to meet him; and so it was done.</p>

  <p>Then when Stein the priest came to Sandhaugar, he knew soon that it
  was Grettir Asmundarson who had come there, and who had called himself
  Guest.</p>

  <p>The priest asked Grettir what he thought must have become of those men
  who had vanished. Grettir said he thought they <!-- Page 179 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page179"></a>{179}</span>must have vanished into
  the gorge. The priest said that he could not believe Grettir's saying, if
  no signs of it were to be seen. Grettir said that they would know more
  accurately about it later. Then the priest went home. Grettir lay many
  days in bed. The good-wife looked after him well, and so the
  Christmas-time passed.</p>

  <p>Grettir's account was that the giantess fell into the gulf when she
  got her wound; but the men of Barthardal say that day came upon her
  whilst they wrestled, and that she burst when he smote her hand off, and
  that she stands there on the cliff yet, a rock in the likeness of a
  woman<a name="NtA307" href="#Nt307"><sup>[307]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The dwellers in the dale kept Grettir in hiding there. But after
  Christmas time, one day that winter, Grettir went to Isledale river. And
  when Grettir and the priest met, Grettir <span class="sidenotel">p. <a
  href="#page160">160</a></span> said "I see, priest, that you place little
  belief in my words. Now will I that you go with me to the river and see
  what the likelihood seems to you to be."</p>

  <p>The priest did so. But when they came to the waterfall they saw that
  the sides of the gorge hung over<a name="NtA308"
  href="#Nt308"><sup>[308]</sup></a>: it was a sheer cliff so great that
  one could in nowise come up, and it was nearly ten fathoms<a
  name="NtA309" href="#Nt309"><sup>[309]</sup></a> from the top to the
  water below. They had a rope with them. Then the priest said, "It seems
  to me quite impossible for thee to get down."</p>

  <p>Grettir said, "Assuredly it is possible, but best for those who are
  men of valour. I will examine what is in the waterfall, and thou shalt
  watch the rope."</p>

<p><!-- Page 180 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page180"></a>{180}</span></p>

  <p>The priest said it should be as he wished, drove a peg into the cliff,
  piled stones against it, and sat by it<a name="NtA310"
  href="#Nt310"><sup>[310]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Now it must be told concerning Grettir that he knotted a stone into
  the rope, and so let it down to the water.</p>

  <p>"What way," said the priest, "do you mean to go?"</p>

  <p>"I will not be bound," said Grettir, "when I go into the water, so
  much my mind forebodes me."</p>

  <p>After that he got ready for his exploit, and had little on; he girded
  himself with his short sword, and had no other weapon.</p>

  <p>Then he plunged from the cliff down into the waterfall. The priest saw
  the soles of his feet, and knew no more what had become of him. Grettir
  dived under the waterfall, and that was difficult because there was a
  great eddy, and he had to dive right to the bottom before he could come
  up behind the waterfall. There was a jutting rock and he climbed upon it.
  There was a great cave behind the waterfall, and the river fell in front
  of it from the precipice. He went into the cave, and there was a big fire
  burning. Grettir saw that there sat a giant of frightful size. He was
  terrible to look upon: but when Grettir came to him, the giant leapt up
  and seized a pike, and hewed at the new-comer: for with the pike he could
  both cut and stab. It had a handle of wood: men at that time called a
  weapon made in such a way a <i>heptisax</i>. Grettir smote against it
  with his short sword, and struck the handle so that he cut it asunder.
  Then the giant tried to reach back for a sword which hung behind him in
  the cave. Thereupon Grettir smote him in the breast, and struck off
  almost all the lower part of his chest and his belly, so that the
  entrails gushed out of him down into the river, and were swept along the
  current.</p>

  <p>And as the priest sat by the rope he saw some lumps, clotted <span
  class="sidenotel">p. <a href="#page161">161</a></span> with blood,
  carried down stream. Then he became unsteady, and thought that now he
  knew that Grettir must be dead: and he ran from keeping the rope and went
  home. It was then evening, and the priest said for certain that Grettir
  was dead, and added that it was a great loss of such a man.</p>

  <p>Now the tale must be told concerning Grettir. He let little space go
  between his blows till the giant was dead. Then he <!-- Page 181 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page181"></a>{181}</span>went further into the
  cave; he kindled a light and examined it. It is not said how much wealth
  he took in the cave, but men think that there was something. He stayed
  there far into the night. He found there the bones of two men, and put
  them into a bag. Then he left the cave and swam to the rope and shook it,
  for he thought that the priest must be there. But when he knew that the
  priest had gone home, then he had to draw himself up, hand over hand, and
  so he came up on to the cliff.</p>

  <p>Then he went home to Isledale river, and came to the church porch,
  with the bag that the bones were in, and with a rune-staff, on which
  these verses were exceedingly well cut:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>There into gloomy gulf I passed,</p>
      <p>O'er which from the rock's throat is cast</p>
      <p>The swirling rush of waters wan,</p>
      <p>To meet the sword-player feared of man.</p>
      <p>By giant's hall the strong stream pressed</p>
      <p>Cold hands against the singer's breast;</p>
      <p>Huge weight upon him there did hurl</p>
      <p>The swallower of the changing whirl<a name="NtA311" href="#Nt311"><sup>[311]</sup></a>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And this rhyme too:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>The dreadful dweller of the cave</p>
      <p>Great strokes and many 'gainst me drave;</p>
      <p>Full hard he had to strive for it,</p>
      <p>But toiling long he wan no whit;</p>
      <p>For from its mighty shaft of tree</p>
      <p>The heft-sax smote I speedily;</p>
      <p>And dulled the flashing war-flame fair</p>
      <p>In the black breast that met me there.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<div class="sidenotel">p. <a href="#page162">162</a></div>
  <p>These verses told also that Grettir had taken these bones out of the
  cave. But when the priest came to the church in the morning he found the
  staff, and what was with it, and read the runes; but Grettir had gone
  home to Sandhaugar.</p>

  <p>But when the priest met Grettir he asked him closely as to what had
  happened: and Grettir told him all the story of his journey. And he added
  that the priest had not watched the rope faithfully. The priest said that
  that was true enough.</p>

  <p>Men thought for certain that these monsters must have caused the loss
  of men there in the dale; and there was never any loss from hauntings or
  spirit-walkings there afterwards.</p>

<p><!-- Page 182 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page182"></a>{182}</span></p>

  <p>Grettir was thought to have caused a great purging of the land. The
  priest buried these bones in the churchyard.</p>

  <p>58. Most [of Rolf's retainers] much tormented Hott [Hjalti]; he was
  not cunning in speech. One day Hjalti and Bothvar went out of the hall,
  in such wise that none of the retainers knew thereof. <!-- Page 185
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page185"></a>{185}</span></p>

  <p>59. Hjalti spake in great terror, "Let us not go near the wood; here
  is the she-wolf who eats up men; she will kill us both together."</p>

  <p>60. The she-wolf leapt from a thicket, dread, with gaping jaws. A
  great terror was it to Hjalti, and he trembled in every limb.</p>

  <p>61. Without delay or hesitation went Bjarki towards her, and hewed at
  her so that the axe went deep; a monstrous stream of blood gushed from
  her.</p>

  <p>62. "Choose now, Hjalti, of two things"&mdash;so spake Bothvar the
  champion&mdash;"Drink now the blood, or I slay thee here; it seems unto
  me that there is no valour in thee."</p>

  <p>63. Hjalti replied stoutly enough, "I cannot bring myself to drink
  blood; but if I needs must, it avails most [to submit], and now is there
  no better choice."</p>

  <p>64. Hjalti did as Bothvar bade: he stooped down to the blood; then
  drank he three sups: that will suffice him to wrestle with one man.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="scac">IV</span>, 58-64.</p>

  <p>4. He [Hjalti] has gained good courage and keen spirit; he got
  strength and all valour from the she-wolf's blood.</p>

  <p>5. A grey bear visited the folds at Hleithargarth; many such a ravager
  was there far and wide throughout the country.</p>

  <p>6. The blame was laid upon Bjarki, because he had slain the herdsmen's
  dogs; it was not so suited for him to have to strive with men<a
  name="NtA312" href="#Nt312"><sup>[312]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>7. Rolf and all his household prepared to hunt the bear; "He who faces
  the beast shall be greatest in my hall."</p>

  <p>8. Roaring did the bear leap forth from out its den, swinging its evil
  claws, so that men shrank back.</p>

  <p>9. Hjalti saw, he turned and gazed where the battle began; nought had
  he then in his hands&mdash;his empty fists alone.</p>

<p><!-- Page 186 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page186"></a>{186}</span></p>

  <p>10. Rolf tossed then to Hjalti his wand of war [his sword]; the
  warrior put forth his hand towards it, and grasped the pommel.</p>

  <p>11. Quickly then he smote the bear in the right shoulder; Bruin fell
  to the earth, and bore himself in more lowly wise.</p>

  <p>12. That was the beginning of his exploits: many followed later; his
  spirit was ever excellent amid the play of battle.</p>

  <p>13. Herefrom he got the name of Hjalti the stout-hearted: Bjarki was
  no more than his equal.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="scac">V</span>, 4-13.</p>

  <p>23. Joyful was the valiant Athils when they [Bjarki and Rolf's
  champions] came east to that place [Lake Wener]; troops with flashing
  spears rode quickly forthwith to the battle.</p>

  <p>24. No truce gave they to their foes: well they earned their pay;
  there fell Ali and all his host, young in the game of swords.</p>

  <p>25. The best of horses, Hrafn by name, they took from Ali; Bjarki
  chose for his reward the helm Hildisvin.</p>

  <p>26. The prince [Athils] bade them have no talk about the business; he
  deprived the champions<a name="NtA313" href="#Nt313"><sup>[313]</sup></a>
  of their treasures&mdash;that will be a test of his power.</p>

  <p>27. Ill-pleased was Bothvar: he and Hjalti departed; they declared
  that before the winter was gone they would seek for the treasure [the
  malt of Frothi].</p>

  <p>28. Then they rode home and told it to the king [Rolf]; he said it was
  their business to claim their due outright.</p>

  <p>7. Litlu síðarr enn þeir Ormr ok Ásbj&#x1EB;rn h&#x1EB;fðu skilit,
  fýstist Ásbj&#x1EB;rn norðr í Sauðeyjar, fór hann við 4 menn ok 20 á

  ytri, gánga á land ok reisa tjald, eru þar um nóttina, ok verða við ekki
  varir; um morgininn árla rís Ásbj&#x1EB;rn upp, klæðir sik, ok tekr vópn
  sín, ok gengr uppá land, en biðr menn sína bíða sín; en er nokkut svá var
  liðit frá því, er Ásbj&#x1EB;rn hafði í brott gengit, verða þeir við þat
  varir, at ketta ógrlig var komin í tjaldsdyrnar, hon var kolsv&#x1EB;rt
  at lit ok heldr grimmlig, þvíat eldr þótti brenna or n&#x1EB;sum hennar
  ok munni, eigi var hon ok vel eyg; þeim brá mj&#x1EB;k við þessa sýn, ok
  urðu óttafullir. Ketta hleypr þá innar at þeim, ok grípr hvern at
  &#x1EB;ðrum, ok svá er sagt at suma gleypti hon, en suma rifi hon til
  dauðs með klóm ok t&#x1EB;nnum, 20 menn drap hon þar á lítilli stundu, en
  3 kvómust út ok undan ok á skip, ok héldu þegar undan landi; en
  Ásbj&#x1EB;rn gengr þar til, er hann kemr at hellinum Brúsa, ok snarar
  þegar inn í; honum varð nokkut dimt fyrir augum, en skuggamikit var í
  hellinum; hann verðr eigi fyrr var við, enn hann er þrifinn álopt, ok
  færðr niðr svá hart, at Ásbirni þótti furða í, verðr hann þess þá varr,
  at þar er kominn Brúsi j&#x1EB;tun, ok sýndist heldr mikiligr. Brúsi
  mælti þá: þó lagðir þú mikit kapp á at sækja híngat; skaltu nú ok eyrindi
  hafa, þvíat þú skalt hér lífit láta með svá miklum harmkvælum, at þat
  skal aðra letja at sækja mik heim með ófriði; fletti hann þá
  Ásbj&#x1EB;rn klæðum, þvíat svá, var þeirra mikill afla munr, at
  j&#x1EB;tuninn varð einn at ráða þeirra í milli; bálk mikinn sá
  Ásbj&#x1EB;rn standa um þveran hellinn ok stórt gat á miðjum bálkinum;
  járnsúla stór stóð nokkut svá fyrir framan bálkinn. Nú skal prófa þat,
  segir Brúsi, hvárt þú ert nokkut harðari enn aðrir menn. Lítit mun þat at
  reyna, segir Ásbj&#x1EB;rn....</p>

  <p>Síðan lét Ásbj&#x1EB;rn líf sitt með mikilli hreysti ok
  dreingskap.</p>

  <p>8. Þat er at segja at þeir þrír menn, er undan kómust, sóttu knáliga

  líflát; kvómu þeir sér i skip með kaupm&#x1EB;nnum, ok fluttust svá suðr
  til Danmerkr; spurðust nú þessi tíðindi víða, ok þóttu mikil. Þa var
  orðit h&#x1EB;fðíngja skipti í Noregi, Hakon jarl dauðr, en Ólafr
  Tryggvason í land kominn, ok bauð &#x1EB;llum rétta trú. Ormr Stórólfsson
  spurði út til Íslands um <!-- Page 188 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  þótti sem vera mundi; þótti honum þat allmikill skaði, ok undi eigi lengr

  norðarliga við Noreg, ok sat hann um vetrinn í Þrándheimi; þá hafði Ólafr
  ráðit 3 vetr Noregi. Um vórit bjóst Ormr at fara til Sauðeya, þeir vóru
  því nærr margir á skipi, sem þeir Ásbj&#x1EB;rn h[,]fðu verit; þeir
  l&#x1EB;gðu at minni Sauðey síð um kveldit, ok tj&#x1EB;lduðu á landi, ok
  lágu þar um náttina....</p>

  <p>9. Nú gengr Ormr þar til er hann kemr at hellinum, sér hann nú bjargit
  þat stóra, ok leizt úmátuligt nokkurum manni þat í brott at færa; þó
  dregr hann á sik glófana Menglaðarnauta, tekr síðan á bjarginu ok færir
  þat burt or dyrunum, ok þikist Ormr þá aflraun mesta sýnt hafa; hann gekk
  þá inní hellinn, ok lagði málajárn í dyrnar, en er hann var inn kominn,
  sá hann hvar kettan hljóp með gapanda ginit. Ormr hafði boga ok
  &#x1EB;rvamæli, lagði hann þá &#x1EB;r á streing, ok skaut at kettunni
  þremr &#x1EB;rum, en hon hendi allar með hvoptunum, ok beit í sundr,
  hefir hon sik þá at Ormi, ok rekr klærnar framan í fángit, svá at Ormr
  kiknar við, en klærnar gengu í gegnum klæðin svá at í beini stóð; hon
  ætlar þá at bíta í andlit Ormi, finnr hann þá at honum mun eigi veita,
  heitir þá á sjálfan guð ok hinn heilaga Petrum postula, at gánga til
  Róms, ef hann ynni kettuna ok Brúsa, son hennar; síðan fann Ormr at
  mínkaðist afl kettunnar, tekr hann þá annarri hendi um kverkr henni, en
  annarri um hrygg, ok gengr hana á bak, ok brýtr ísundr í henni hrygginn,
  ok gengr svá af henni dauðri. Ormr sá þá, hvar bálkr stórr var um þveran
  hellinn; hann gengr þá innar at, en er hann kemr þar, sér hann at fleinn
  mikill kemr utar í gegnum bálkinn, hann var bæði digr ok lángr; Ormr
  grípr þá í móti fleininum, ok leggr af út; Brúsi kippir þá at sér
  fleininum ok var hann fastr svá at hvergi gekk; þat undraðist Brúsi, ok
  gægdist upp yfir bálkinn, en er Ormr sér þat, þrífr hann í skeggit á
  Brúsa báðum h&#x1EB;ndum, en Brúsi bregzt við í &#x1EB;ðrum stað,
  sviptast þeir þá fast um bálkinn. Ormr hafði vafit skegginu um h&#x1EB;nd
  sér, ok rykkir til svá fast, at hann rífr af Brúsa allan skeggstaðinn,
  h&#x1EB;kuna, kjaptana báða, vángafyllurnar upp alt at eyrum, gekk hér
  með holdit niðr at beini. Brúsi lét þá <!-- Page 189 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page189"></a>{189}</span>síga brýnnar, ok
  grettist heldr greppiliga. Ormr st&#x1EB;kkr þá innar yfir bálkinn,
  grípast þeir þá til ok glíma lengi, mæddi Brúsa þá fast blóðrás, tekr
  hann þá heldr at gángast fyrir, gefr Ormr þá á, ok rekr Brúsa at bálkinum
  ok brýtr hann þar um á bak aptr. Snemma sagði mér þat hugr, sagði Brúsi,
  at ek munda af þér nokkut erfitt fá, þegar ek heyrða þín getit, enda er
  þat nú fram komit, muntu nú vinna skjótt um, ok h&#x1EB;ggva h&#x1EB;fuð
  af mér, en þat var satt, at mj&#x1EB;k pínda ek Ásbj&#x1EB;rn prúða, þá
  er ek rakta or honum alla þarmana, ok gaf hann sik ekki við, fyrrenn hann
  dó. Illa gerðir þú þat, segir Ormr, at pína hann svá mj&#x1EB;k
  jafnr&#x1EB;skvan mann, skaltu ok hafa þess nokkurar menjar. Hann brá þá
  saxi ok reist blóð&#x1EB;rn á baki honum, ok skar &#x1EB;ll rifin frá
  hryggnum, ok dró þar út lúngun; lét Brúsi svá líf sitt með litlum
  dreingskap; síðan bar Ormr eld at, ok brendi upp til &#x1EB;sku bæði
  Brúsa ok kettuna, ok er hann hafði þetta starfat, fór hann burt or
  hellinum með kistur tvær fullar af gulli ok silfri, en þat sem meira var
  fémætt, gaf hann í vald Menglaðar, ok svá eyna; skildu þau með mikilli
  vináttu, kom Ormr til manna sinna í nefndan tíma, héldu síðan til
  meginlands. Sat Ormr í Þrándheimi vetr annan.</p>

<p class="cenhead">7.</p>

  <p>A little after Orm and Asbiorn had parted, Asbiorn wished to go north
  to Sandeyar<a name="NtA314" href="#Nt314"><sup>[314]</sup></a>; he went
  aboard with twenty-four men, went north past Mæri, and landed late in the
  day at the outermost of the Sandeyar<a
  href="#Nt314"><sup>[314]</sup></a>. They landed and pitched a tent, and
  spent the night there, and met with nothing.</p>

  <p>Early in the morning Asbiorn arose, clothed himself, took his arms,
  went inland, and bade his men wait for him.</p>

  <p>But when some time had passed from Asbiorn's having gone away, they
  were aware that a monstrous<a name="NtA315"
  href="#Nt315"><sup>[315]</sup></a> cat had come to the <!-- Page 190
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page190"></a>{190}</span>door of the
  tent: she was coal-black in colour and very fierce, for it seemed as if
  fire was burning from her nostrils and mouth, and her eyes were nothing
  fair: they were much startled at this sight, and full of fear. Then the
  cat leapt within the tent upon them, and gripped one after the other, and
  so it is said that some she swallowed and some she tore to death with
  claws and teeth. Twenty men she killed in a short time, and three escaped
  aboard ship, and stood away from the shore.</p>

  <p>But Asbiorn went till he came to the cave of Brusi, and hastened in
  forthwith. It was dim before his eyes, and very shadowy in the cave, and
  before he was aware of it, he was caught off his feet, and thrown down so
  violently that it seemed strange to him. Then was he aware that there was
  come the giant Brusi, and he seemed to him a great one.</p>

  <p>Then said Brusi, "Thou didst seek with great eagerness to come
  hither&mdash;now shalt thou have business, in that thou shalt here leave
  thy life with so great torments that that shall stay others from
  attacking me in my lair."</p>

  <p>Then he stripped Asbiorn of his clothes, forasmuch as so great was
  their difference in strength that the giant could do as he wished.
  Asbiorn saw a great barrier standing across the cave, and a mighty
  opening in the midst of it; a great iron column stood somewhat in front
  of the barrier. "Now it must be tried," said Brusi, "whether thou art
  somewhat hardier than other men." "Little will that be to test," said
  Asbiorn....</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>[Asbiorn then recites ten stanzas, Brusi tormenting him the while. The
  first stanza is almost identical with No. 50 in the <i>Grettis
  saga</i>.]</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Then Asbiorn left his life with great valour and hardihood.</p>

<p class="cenhead">8.</p>

  <p>Now it must be told concerning the three men who escaped; they rowed
  strongly, and stopped not until they came to land. They told the tidings
  of what had happened in their journey, and said that they thought that
  Asbiorn was dead, but that they could not tell how matters had happened
  concerning his death. They took ship with merchants, and so went south to
  <!-- Page 191 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page191"></a>{191}</span>Denmark: now these tidings were spread far
  and wide, and seemed weighty.</p>

  <p>There had been a change of rulers in Norway: jarl Hakon was dead, and
  Olaf Tryggvason come to land: and he proclaimed the true faith to all.
  Orm Storolfson heard, out in Iceland, about the expedition of Asbiorn,
  and the death which it seemed to men must have come upon him. It seemed
  to him a great loss, and he cared no longer to be in Iceland, and took
  passage at Reytharfirth and went abroad. They reached Norway far to the
  north, and he stayed the winter at Thrandheim: Olaf at that time had
  reigned three years in Norway.</p>

  <p>In the spring Orm made ready for his journey to Sandeyar, and there
  were nearly as many in the ship as the company of Asbiorn had been.</p>

  <p>They landed at Little Sandey late in the evening, and pitched a tent
  on the land, and lay there the night....</p>

<p class="cenhead">9.</p>

  <p>Now Orm went till he came to the cave. He saw the great rock, and
  thought it was impossible for any man to move it. Then he drew on the
  gloves that Menglath had given him, and grasped the rock and moved it
  away from the door; this is reckoned Orm's great feat of strength. Then
  he went into the cave, and thrust his weapon against the door. When he
  came in, he saw a giantess (she-cat) springing towards him with gaping
  jaws. Orm had a bow and quiver; he put the arrow on the string, and shot
  thrice at the giantess. But she seized all the arrows in her mouth, and
  bit them asunder. Then she flung herself upon Orm, and thrust her claws
  into his breast, so that Orm stumbled, and her claws went through his
  clothes and pierced him to the bone. She tried then to bite his face, and
  Orm found himself in straits: he promised then to God, and the holy
  apostle Peter, to go to Rome, if he conquered the giantess and Brusi her
  son. Then Orm felt the power of the giantess diminishing: he placed one
  hand round her throat, and the other round her back, and bent it till he
  broke it in two, and so left her dead.</p>

  <p>Then Orm saw where a great barrier ran across the cave: he went
  further in, and when he came to it he saw a great shaft <!-- Page 192
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page192"></a>{192}</span>coming out
  through the barrier, both long and thick. Orm gripped the shaft and drew
  it away; Brusi pulled it towards himself, but it did not yield. Then
  Brusi wondered, and peeped up over the barrier. But when Orm saw that, he
  gripped Brusi by the beard with both hands, but Brusi pulled away, and so
  they tugged across the barrier. Orm twisted the beard round his hand, and
  tugged so violently that he pulled the flesh of Brusi away from the
  bone&mdash;from chin, jaws, cheeks, right up to the ears. Brusi knitted
  his brows and made a hideous face. Then Orm leapt in over the barrier,
  and they grappled and wrestled for a long time. But loss of blood wearied
  Brusi, and he began to fail in strength. Orm pressed on, pushed Brusi to
  the barrier, and broke his back across it. "Right early did my mind
  misgive me," said Brusi, "even so soon as I heard of thee, that I should
  have trouble from thee: and now has that come to pass. But now make quick
  work, and hew off my head. And true it is that much did I torture the
  gallant Asbiorn, in that I tore out all his entrails&mdash;yet did he not
  give in, before he died." "Ill didst thou do," said Orm, "to torture him,
  so fine a man as he was, and thou shalt have something in memory
  thereof." Then he drew his knife, and cut the "blood eagle" in the back
  of Brusi, shore off his ribs and drew out his lungs. So Brusi died in
  cowardly wise. Then Orm took fire, and burned to ashes both Brusi and the
  giantess. And when he had done that, he left the cave, with two chests
  full of gold and silver.</p>

  <p>And all that was most of value he gave to Menglath, and the island
  likewise. So they parted with great friendship, and Orm came to his men
  at the time appointed, and then they sailed to the mainland. Orm remained
  a second winter at Thrandheim.</p>

  <p>Paa den Tid, da kong Gram Guldkølve regierede i Leire, vare der ved
  Hoffet to Ministre, Bessus og Henrik. Og da der paa samme Tid indkom
  idelige klager fra Indbyggerne i Vendsyssel, at et grueligt Udyr, som
  Bønderne kaldte Lindorm, ødelagde baade Mennesker og Kreaturer, gav
  Bessus det Raad, at Kongen skulde sende Henrik did hen, efterdi ingen i
  det ganske Rige kunde maale sig med ham in Tapperhed og Mod. Da svarede
  <!-- Page 193 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page193"></a>{193}</span>Henrik, at han vel vilde paatage sig
  dette, dog tilføiede han, at han ansaae det for umuligt at slippe fra
  saadan Kamp med Livet. Og belavede han sig da strax til Reisen, tog
  rørende Afsked med sin Herre og Konge og sagde iblandt andet: "Herre! om
  jeg ikke kommer tilbage, da sørg for min kone og for mine Børn!" Da han
  derefter var kommen over til Vendsyssel, lod han sig af Bønderne vise det
  Sted, hvor Uhyret havde sit Leie, og fik da at vide, at Ormen endnu den
  samme Dag havde været ude af Hulen og borttaget en Hyrde og en Oxe, og at
  den efter Sædvane nu ikke vilde komme ud, førend om tre Timer, naar den
  skulde ned til Vandet for at drikke efter Maaltidet. Henrik iførte sig da
  sin fulde Rustning, og eftersom Ingen vovede at staae ham bi i dette
  Arbeide, lagde han sig ganske alene ved Vandet, dog saaledes, at Vinden
  ikke bar fra ham henimod Dyret. Da udsendte han først en vældig Piil fra
  sin Bue, men uagtet den rammede nøie det sted, hvortil han havde sigtet,
  tørnede den dog tilbage fra Ormens haarde Skæl. Herover blev Uhyret saa
  optændt af Vrede, at det strax gik henimod ham, agtende ham kun et ringe
  Maaltid; men Henrik havde iforveien hos en Smed ladet sig giøre en stor
  Krog med Gjenhold, hvilken han jog ind i Beestets aabne Gab, saa at det
  ikke kunde blive den qvit, ihvormeget det end arbeidede, og ihvorvel
  Jernstangen brast i Henriks Hænder. Da slog det ham med sin vældige Hale
  til Jorden, og skiøndt han havde fuldkommen Jernrustning paa, kradsede
  det dog med sine forfærdelige Kløer saa at han, næsten dødeligt saaret,
  faldt i Besvimelse. Men da han, efterat Ormen i nogen Tid havde haft ham
  liggende under sin Bug, endelig kom lidt til sin Samling igien, greb han
  af yderste Evne en Daggert, af hvilke han førte flere med sig i sit
  Bælte, og stak Dyret dermed i underlivet, hvor Sksællene vare blødest,
  saa at det tilsidst maate udpuste sin giftige Aande, medens han selv laae
  halv knust under dens Byrde. Da Bønderne i Vendsyssel som stode i nogen
  Afstand, under megen Frygt og lidet Haab omsider mærkede, at Striden
  sagtnede, og at begge Parter holdte sig rolige, nærmede de sig og fandt
  Hr. Henrik næsten livløs under det dræbte Udyr. Og efterat de i nogen Tid
  havde givet ham god Pleie, vendte han tilbage for at dø hos sin Konge,
  til hvem han gientagende anbefalede sin <!-- Page 194 --><span

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.</span></p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Translation.</i></p>

  <p>In the days when King Gram Guldkølve ruled in Leire, there were two
  ministers at court, Bessus and Henry. And at that time constant
  complaints came to the court from the inhabitants of Vendsyssel, that a
  dread monster, which the peasants called a Drake, was destroying both man
  and beast. So Bessus gave counsel, that the king should send Henry
  against the dragon, seeing that no one in the whole kingdom was his equal
  in valour and courage. Henry answered that assuredly he would undertake
  it; but he added that he thought it impossible to escape from such a
  struggle with his life. And he made himself ready forthwith for the
  expedition, took a touching farewell of his lord and king, and said among
  other things: "My lord, if I come not back, care thou for my wife and my
  children."</p>

  <p>Afterwards, when he crossed over to Vendsyssel, he caused the peasants
  to show him the place where the monster had its lair, and learnt how that
  very day the drake had been out of its den, and had carried off a
  herdsman and an ox; how, according to its wont, it would now not come out
  for three hours, when it would want to go down to the water to drink
  after its meal. Henry clothed himself in full armour, and inasmuch as no
  one dared to stand by him in that task, he lay down all alone by the
  water, but in such wise that the wind did not blow from him toward the
  monster. First of all he sent a mighty arrow from his bow: but, although
  it exactly hit the spot at which he had aimed, it darted back from the
  dragon's hard scales. At this the monster was so maddened, that it
  attacked him forthwith, reckoning him but a little meal. But Henry had
  had a mighty barbed crook prepared by a smith beforehand, which he thrust
  into the beast's open mouth, so that it could <!-- Page 195 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page195"></a>{195}</span>not get rid of it,
  however much it strove, although the iron rod broke in Henry's hands.
  Then it smote him to the ground with its mighty tail, and although he was
  in complete armour, clutched at him with its dread claws, so that he fell
  in a swoon, wounded almost to death. But when he came somewhat to his
  senses again, after the drake for some time had had him lying under its
  belly, he rallied his last strength and grasped a dagger, of which he
  carried several with him in his belt, and smote it therewith in the
  belly, where the scales were weakest. So the monster at last breathed out
  its poisoned breath, whilst he himself lay half crushed under its weight.
  When the Vendsyssel peasants, who stood some distance away, in great fear
  and little hope, at last noticed that the battle had slackened, and that
  both combatants were still, they drew near and found Henry almost
  lifeless under the slain monster. And after they for some time had tended
  him well, he returned to die by his king, to whom he again commended his
  offspring. From him descends the family Lindenroth, which in memory of
  this mighty contest carries a drake on its coat of arms.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>This story resembles the dragon fight in <i>Beowulf</i>, in that the
  hero faces the dragon as protector of the land, with forebodings, and
  after taking farewell; he attacks the dragon in its lair, single-handed;
  his first attack is frustrated by the dragon's scales; in spite of
  apparatus specially prepared, he is wounded and stunned by the dragon,
  but nevertheless smites the dragon in the soft parts and slays him; the
  watchers draw near when the fight is over. Yet these things merely prove
  that the two stories are of the same type; there is no evidence that this
  story is descended from <i>Beowulf</i>.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">G. The Old English Genealogies.</span></p>

<p class="cenhead">I. <i>THE MERCIAN GENEALOGY</i>.</p>

  <p>Of the Old English Genealogies, the only one which, in its stages
  <i>below</i> Woden, immediately concerns the student of <i>Beowulf</i> is
  the Mercian. This contains three names which also occur in
  <i>Beowulf</i>, though two of them in a corrupt form&mdash;Offa, Wermund
  (Garmund, <i>Beowulf</i>), and Eomær (Geomor, <i>Beowulf</i>).</p>

  <p>This Mercian pedigree is found in its best form in <i>MS Cotton Vesp.
  B. VI</i>, fol. 109 <i>b</i>,<a name="NtA316"
  href="#Nt316"><sup>[316]</sup></a> and in the sister <span
  class="scac">MS</span> at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge
  (<i>C.C.C.C.</i> 183)<a name="NtA317" href="#Nt317"><sup>[317]</sup></a>.
  Both these <span class="scac">MSS</span> are of <!-- Page 196 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page196"></a>{196}</span>the 9th century. They
  contain lists of popes and bishops, and pedigrees of kings. By noting
  where these lists stop, we get a limit for the final compilation of the
  document. It must have been drawn up in its present form between 811 and
  814<a name="NtA318" href="#Nt318"><sup>[318]</sup></a>. But it was
  obviously compiled from lists already existing, and some of them were
  even at that date old. For the genealogy of the Mercian kings, from
  Woden, is not traced directly down to this period 811-814, but in the
  first place only as far as Æthelred (reigning 675-704), son of Penda:
  that is to say, it stops considerably more than a century before the date
  of the document in which it appears. Additional pedigrees are then
  appended which show the subsequent stages down to and including Cenwulf,
  king of Mercia (reigning 796-821). It is difficult to account for such an
  arrangement except on the hypothesis that the genealogy was committed to
  writing in the reign of Æthelred, the monarch with whose name it
  terminates in its first form, and was then brought up to date by the
  addition of the supplementary names ending with Cenwulf. This is
  confirmed when we find that precisely the same arrangement holds good for
  the accompanying Northumbrian pedigree, which terminates with Ecgfrith
  (670-685), the contemporary of Æthelred of Mercia, and is then brought up
  to date by additional names.</p>

  <p>Genealogies which draw from the same source as the <i>Vespasian</i>
  genealogies, and show the same peculiarities, are found in the
  <i>Historia Brittonum</i> (§§ 57-61). They show, even more emphatically
  than do the <i>Vespasian</i> lists, traces of having been originally
  drawn up in the time of Æthelred of Mercia (675-704) or possibly of his
  father Penda, and of having then been brought up to date in subsequent
  revisions<a name="NtA319" href="#Nt319"><sup>[319]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>One such revision must have been made about 796<a name="NtA320"
  href="#Nt320"><sup>[320]</sup></a>: it is a <!-- Page 197 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page197"></a>{197}</span>modification of this
  revision which is found in the <i>Historia Brittonum</i>. Another was
  that which, as we have seen, must have been made between 811-814, and in
  this form is found in <i>MS Cotton Vespasian B. VI</i>, <i>MS
  C.C.C.C.</i> 183, both of the 9th century, and in the (much later) <i>MS
  Cotton Tiberius B. V</i>.</p>

  <p>The genealogy up to Penda is also found in the <i>A.-S. Chronicle</i>
  under the year 626 (accession of Penda).</p>

  <p>This Mercian list, together with the Northumbrian and other pedigrees
  which accompany it, can claim to be the earliest extant English
  historical document, having been written down in the 7th century, and
  recording historic names which (allowing thirty years for a generation)
  cannot be later than the 4th century <span class="scac">A.D.</span> In
  most similar pedigrees the earliest names are meaningless to us. But the
  Mercian pedigree differs from the rest, in that we are able from
  <i>Beowulf</i>, <i>Widsith</i>, Saxo Grammaticus, Sweyn Aageson and the
  <i>Vitae Offarum</i>, to attach stories to the names of Wermund and Offa.
  How much of these stories is history, and how much fiction, it is
  difficult to say&mdash;but, with them, extant English history and English
  poetry and English fiction alike have their beginning.</p>

<p class="cenhead">II. <i>THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN.</i></p>

<p class="cenhead">(1) <i>WODEN TO GEAT.</i></p>

  <p>The stages above Woden are found in two forms: a short list which
  traces the line from Woden up to Geat: and a longer list which carries
  the line from Geat to Sceaf and through Noah to Adam.</p>

  <p>The line from Woden to Geat is found in the <i>Historia Brittonum</i>,
  not with the other genealogies, but in § 31, where the pedigree of the
  Kentish royal family is given, when the arrival of Hengest in Britain is
  recounted. Notwithstanding the dispute regarding the origin and date of
  the <i>Historia Brittonum</i>, there is a pretty general agreement that
  this <i>Woden to Geat</i> pedigree is one of the more primitive elements,
  and is not likely to be much later than the end of the 7th century<a
  name="NtA323" href="#Nt323"><sup>[323]</sup></a>. The original nucleus of
  the <i>Historia Brittonum</i> was revised by <!-- Page 199 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page199"></a>{199}</span>Nennius in the 9th
  century, or possibly at the end of the 8th<a name="NtA324"
  href="#Nt324"><sup>[324]</sup></a>. The earliest <span
  class="scac">MS</span> of the <i>Historia</i>, that of Chartres, belongs
  to the 9th or 10th century&mdash;this is fragmentary and already
  interpolated; the received text is based upon <i>MS Harleian</i> 3859,
  dating from the end of the 11th century<a name="NtA325"
  href="#Nt325"><sup>[325]</sup></a>, or possibly somewhat later.</p>

  <p>I give the pedigree in four forms:</p>

  <p>A. The critical text of the <i>Historia Brittonum</i> as edited by Th.
  Mommsen (<i>Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Auct. Antiq., Chronica
  Minora</i>, <span class="scac">III</span>, Berolini, 1898, p. 171).</p>

  <p>B. <i>MS Harl.</i> 3859, upon which Mommsen's text is based, fol.
  180.</p>

  <p>C. The <i>Chartres MS.</i></p>

  <p>D. Mommsen's critical text of the later revision, <i>Nennius
  interpretatus</i>, which he gives parallel to the <i>Historia
  Brittonum</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Fodepald</i> or <i>Folcpald</i> who, in the <i>Historia
  Brittonum</i>, appears as the father of Finn, is clearly the
  <i>Folcwalda</i> who appears as Finn's father in <i>Beowulf</i> and
  <i>Widsith</i>. The Old English <i>w</i> (&#x1BF;) has been mistaken for
  <i>p</i>, just as in <i>Pinefred</i> for <i>Winefred</i> in the <i>Life
  of Offa II</i>. In the <i>Vespasian MS</i> and in other genealogies
  Godwulf is Finn's father. It has been very generally held that Finn and
  his father Godwulf are mythical heroes, quite distinct from the
  presumably historic Finn, son of Folcwalda, mentioned in <i>Beowulf</i>
  and <i>Widsith</i>: and that by confusion <i>Folcwald</i> came to be
  written instead of <i>Godwulf</i> in the genealogy, as given in the
  <i>Historia Brittonum</i>. I doubt whether there is sufficient
  justification for this distinction between a presumed historic Finn
  Folcwalding and a mythical Finn Godwulfing. Is it not possible that
  Godwulf was a traditional, probably historic, king of the Frisians,
  father of Finn, and that <i>Folcwalda</i><a name="NtA327"
  href="#Nt327"><sup>[327]</sup></a> was a <i>title</i> which, since it
  alliterated conveniently, in the end supplanted the proper name in epic
  poetry?</p>

  of that king. Though it doubtless contains ancient names, it is
  apparently not so ancient as the <i>Woden-Geat</i> list. It became very
  well known, and is also found in Asser and the <i>Textus Roffensis</i>.
  It was copied by later historians such as William of Malmesbury, and by

  <i>Annales Esromenses</i>) from <i>Cod. Arn. Mag.</i> 841. There is a

  <p>Erat ergo Dan rex in Dacia<a name="NtA332"
  href="#Nt332"><sup>[332]</sup></a> per triennium. Anno tandem tertio
  cognouit uxorem suam Daniam, genuitque ex ea filium nomine Ro. Qui post
  patris obitum hereditarie possidebat regnum. Patrem uero suum Dan colle
  apud Lethram tumulauit Sialandiæ, ubi sedem regni pro eo pater
  constituit, quam ipse post eum diuitiis multiplicibus ditauit. Tempore
  illo ciuitas magna erat in medio Sialandiæ, ubi adhuc mons desertus est,
  nomine Hekebiarch, ubi sita erat ciuitas quæ Høkekoping nuncupata est; ad
  quam ut mox Ro rex uidit, quod mercatores a nauibus in uia currus
  conducentes multum expenderent, a loco illo ciuitatem amoueri jussit ad
  portum, ubi tenditur Isæfiorth, et circa fontem pulcherrimum domos
  disponere. Ædificauit ibi Ro ciuitatem honestam, cui nomen partitiuum
  imposuit post se et Fontem, partem capiens fontis partemque sui,
  Roskildam Danice uocans, quæ hoc nomine uoca[bi]tur<a name="NtA333"
  href="#Nt333"><sup>[333]</sup></a> in æternum. Uixit autem rex Ro ita
  pacifice, ut nullus ei aciem opponeret, nec ipse usquam expeditionem
  direxit<a name="NtA334" href="#Nt334"><sup>[334]</sup></a>. Erat autem
  uxor eius <!-- Page 205 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  confortari et crescere, obiit pater eorum Ro, et sepultus est tumulo
  quodam Læthræ, post cuius obitum partiti sunt regnum filii, quod in duas
  partes diuidentes, alter terras, alter mare possidebat. Rexit itaque
  terras Haldanus, et genuit filium nomine Siwardum, cognomine Album, qui
  patrem suum Haldanum Læthræ tumulauit mortuum. Helgi autem rex erat
  marinus, et multos ad se traxit malificos, nauali bello bene adeptus

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The Chronicle then tells how Rolf was born, the son of Helgi and Yrse
  or Ursula: also of the death and burial of Helgi.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Filius autem eius et Ursulæ puer crescebat Rolf et fortitudine
  uigebat. Mater uero eius Ursula, uelo uiduitatis deposito, data est regi
  Suethiæ Athislo, qui ex ea filiam sibi genuit, Rolf uero ex matre eius
  sororem nomine Skuld. Interea dum hæc de rege marino Helgi agerentur,
  frater eius, rex Daciæ, mortuus est Haldanus. Post quem<a name="NtA337"
  href="#Nt337"><sup>[337]</sup></a> rex Sweciæ Athisl a Danis suscepit
  tributum.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Interea ... confortabatur filius Helgi, Rolff, cognomine Krake. Quem

  [in]<a name="NtA339" href="#Nt339"><sup>[339]</sup></a> regem
  assumpserunt. Qui Sialandiæ apud Lethram, sicut antecessores sui,
  sæpissime moratus est. Sororem suam nomine Sculd secum habuit, Athisli
  regis filiam, et suæ matris Ursulæ, de qua superius dictum est; quam
  fraterno amore dilexit. Cui provinciam Hornshæræth Sialandiæ ad pascendas
  puellas suas in expensam dedit, in qua uillam ædificauit, nomine
  Sculdelef, unde nomen suscepit. Hoc tempore erat quidam Comes Scaniæ,
  nomine Hiarwarth, Teotonicus genere, Rolf tributarius, qui ad eum procos
  misit, ut <!-- Page 206 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page206"></a>{206}</span>sororem suam Sculd Hiarwardo daret uxorem.
  Quo nolente, propria ipsius uoluntate puellæ clanculo eam raptam sociauit
  sibi. Unde conspirauerunt inter se deliberantes Hiarwart et Sculd,
  quomodo Rolf interficeretur, et Hiarwardus superstes regni heres
  efficeretur. Non post multum vero temporis animosus ad uxoris
  exhortationem Hiarwart Sialandiam classe petiit. Genero suo Rolff
  tributum attulisse simulauit. Die quadam dilucescente ad Læthram misit,
  ut uideret tributum, Rolff nunciauit. Qui cum uidisset non tributum sed
  exercitum armatum, uallatus est Rolff militibus, et a Hyarwardo
  interfectus est. Hyarwardum autem Syalandenses et Scanienses, qui cum eo
  erant, in regem assumpserunt. Qui breui tempore, a mane usque ad primam,
  regali nomine potitus est. Tunc uenit Haky, frater Haghbardi, filius
  Hamundi; Hyarwardum interfecit et Danorum rex effectus est. Quo regnante,
  uenit quidam nomine Fritleff a partibus Septentrionalibus et filiam sibi
  desponsauit Rolff Crake, ex qua filium nomine Frothe genuit, cognomine
  Largus.</p>

  peperissent. Hic Uffo coæuos quosque corporis habitu supergressus, adeo
  hebetis ineptique animi principio iuuentæ existimatus est, ut priuatis ac
  publicis rebus inutilis uideretur. Siquidem ab ineunte ætate nunquam
  Iusus aut ioci consuetudinem præbuit; adeoque humanæ delectationis uacuus
  fuit, ut labiorum continentiam iugi silentio premeret, et seueritatem
  oris a ridendi prorsus officio temperaret. Uerum ut incunabula
  stoliditatis opinione referta habuit, ita post modum conditionis
  contemptum claritate mutauit; et quantum inertiæ spectaculum fuit, tantum
  prudentiæ et fortitudinis exemplum euasit.</p>

  <p>Cumque Wermundus ætatis uitio oculis orbaretur, Saxoniæ rex, Daniam
  duce uacuam ratus, ei per legatos mandat, regnum, quod præter ætatis
  debitum teneat, sibi procurandum committat, ne nimis longa imperii
  auiditate patriam legibus armisque destituat. Qualiter enim regem censeri
  posse, cui senectus animum, cæcitas oculum pari caliginis horrore
  fuscauerit? Quod si abnuat, filiumque habeat, qui cum suo ex prouocatione
  confligere audeat, uictorem regno potiri permittat. Si neutrum probet,
  armis secum, non monitis agendum cognoscat, ut tandem inuitus præbeat,
  quod ultroneus exhibere contemnat. Ad hæc Wermundus, altioribus suspiriis
  fractus, impudentius se ætatis exprobratione lacerari respondit, quem non
  ideo huc infelicitatis senectus prouexerit, quod pugnæ parcus timidius
  iuuentam exegerit. Nec aptius sibi cæcitatis uitium obiectari, quod
  plerunque talem ætatis habitum talis iactura consequi soleat, potiusque
  condolendum calamitati quam insultandum uideatur. Iustius autem Saxoniæ
  regi impatientiæ notam afferri posse, quem potius senis fatum operiri,
  quam imperium poscere decuisset, quod aliquanto præstet defuncto
  succedere, quam uiuum spoliare. Se tamen, ne tanquam delirus priscæ
  libertatis titulos externo uideatur mancipare dominio, propria manu
  prouocationi pariturum. Ad hæc legati, scire se inquiunt, regem suum
  conserendæ cum cæco manus ludibrium perhorrere, quod tam ridiculum
  decernendi genus rubori quam honestati propinquius habeatur. Aptius uero
  per utriusque pignus et sanguinem amborum negotio consuli. Ad hæc
  obstupefactis animo Danis, subitaque responsi ignorantia perculsis, Uffo,
  qui forte cum ceteris aderat, responsionis a patre licentiam flagitabat,
  subitoque uelut ex muto uocalis euasit. Cumque Wermundus, quisnam talem a
  se loquendi copiam postularet, inquireret, ministrique eum ab Uffone
  rogari dixissent, satis esse perhibuit, ut infelicitatis suæ uulneribus
  alienorum fastus illuderet, ne etiam a domesticis simili insultationis
  petulantia uexaretur. Sed satellitibus Uffonem hunc esse pertinaci
  affirmatione testantibus, "Liberum ei sit," inquit, "quisquis est,
  cogitata profari." Tum Uffo, frustra ab eorum rege regnum appeti, inquit,
  quod tam proprii rectoris officio quam <!-- Page 208 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page208"></a>{208}</span>fortissimorum procerum
  armis industriaque niteretur: præterea, nec regi filium nec regno
  successorem deesse. Sciantque, se non solum regis eorum filium, sed etiam
  quemcunque ex gentis suæ fortissimis secum adsciuerit, simul pugna
  aggredi constituisse. Quo audito legati risere, uanam dicti animositatem
  existimantes. Nec mora, condicitur pugnæ locus, eidemque stata temporis
  meta præfigitur. Tantum autem stuporis Uffo loquendi ac prouocandi
  nouitate præsentibus iniecit, ut, utrum uoci eius an fiduciæ plus
  admirationis tributum sit, incertum extiterit.</p>

  <p>Abeuntibus autem legatis, Wermundus, responsionis auctore laudato,
  quod uirtutis fiduciam non in unius, sed duorum prouocatione statuerit,
  potius se ei, quicunque sit, quam superbo hosti regno cessurum perhibuit.
  Uniuersis autem filium eius esse testantibus, qui legatorum fastum
  fiduciæ sublimitate contempserit, propius eum accedere iubet: quod oculis
  nequeat, manibus experturus. Corpore deinde eius curiosius contrectato,
  cum ex artuum granditate lineamentisque filium esse cognosset, fidem
  assertoribus habere c&oelig;pit, percontarique eum, cur suauissimum uocis
  habitum summo dissimulationis studio tegendum curauerit, tantoque ætatis
  spatio sine uoce et cunctis loquendi commerciis degere sustinuerit, ut se
  linguæ prorsus officio defectum natiuæque taciturnitatis uitio obsitum
  credi permitteret? Qui respondit, se paterna hactenus defensione
  contentum, non prius uocis officio opus habuisse, quam domesticam
  prudentiam externa loquacitate pressam animaduerteret. Rogatus item ab
  eo, cur duos quam unum prouocare maluit, hunc iccirco dimicationis modum
  a se exoptatum respondit, ut Athisli regis oppressio, quæ, quod a duobus
  gesta fuerat, Danis opprobrio extabat, unius facinore pensaretur,
  nouumque uirtutis specimen prisca ruboris monumenta conuelleret. Ita
  antiquæ crimen infamiæ recentis famæ litura respergendum dicebat. Quem
  Wermundus iustam omnium æstimationem fecisse testatus, armorum usum, quod
  eis parum assueuisset, prædiscere iubet. Quibus Uffo oblatis, magnitudine
  pectoris angustos loricarum nexus explicuit; nec erat ullam reperire, quæ
  eum iusto capacitatis spatio contineret. Maiore siquidem corpore erat,
  quam ut alienis armis uti posset. Ad ultimum, cum paternam quoque <!--
  Page 209 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page209"></a>{209}</span>loricam uiolenta corporis astrictione
  dissolueret, Wermundus eam a læuo latere dissecari, fibulaque sarciri
  præcepit, partem, quæ clypei præsidio muniatur, ferro patere parui
  existimans. Sed et gladium, quo tuto uti possit, summa ab eo cura
  conscisci iussit. Oblatis compluribus, Uffo manu capulum stringens,
  frustatim singulos agitando comminuit; nec erat quisquam ex eis tanti
  rigoris gladius, quem non ad primæ concussionis motum crebra partium
  fractione dissolueret. Erat autem regi inusitati acuminis gladius, Skrep
  dictus, qui quodlibet obstaculi genus uno ferientis ictu medium
  penetrando diffinderet, nec adeo quicquam prædurum foret, ut adactam eius
  aciem remorari potuisset. Quem ne posteris fruendum relinqueret, per
  summam alienæ commoditatis inuidiam in profunda defoderat, utilitatem
  ferri, quod filii incrementis diffideret, ceteris negaturus. Interrogatus
  autem, an dignum Uffonis robore ferrum haberet, habere se dixit, quod, si
  pridem a se terræ traditum recognito locorum habitu reperire potuisset,
  aptum corporis eius uiribus exhiberet. In campum deinde perduci se
  iubens, cum, interrogatis per omnia comitibus, defossionis locum acceptis
  signorum indiciis comperisset, extractum cauo gladium filio porrigit.
  Quem Uffo nimia uetustate fragilem exesumque conspiciens, feriendi
  diffidentia percontatur, an hunc quoque priorum exemplo probare debeat,
  prius habitum eius, quam rem ferro geri oporteat, explorandum testatus.
  Refert Wermundus, si præsens ferrum ab ipso uentilando collideretur, non
  superesse, quod uirium eius habitui responderet. Abstinendum itaque
  facto, cuius in dubio exitus maneat.</p>

  <p>Igitur ex pacto pugnæ locus expetitur. Hunc fluuius Eidorus ita
  aquarum ambitu uallat, ut earum interstitio repugnante, nauigii duntaxat
  aditus pateat. Quem Uffone sine comite petente, Saxoniæ regis filium
  insignis uiribus athleta consequitur, crebris utrinque turbis alternos
  riparum anfractus spectandi auiditate complentibus. Cunctis igitur huic
  spectaculo oculos inferentibus, Wermundus in extrema pontis parte se
  collocat, si filium uinci contigisset, flumine periturus. Maluit enim
  sanguinis sui ruinam comitari, quam patriæ interitum plenis doloris
  sensibus intueri. Uerum Uffo, geminis iuuenum congressibus lacessitus,
  gladii diffidentia amborum ictus umbone <!-- Page 210 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page210"></a>{210}</span>uitabat, patientius
  experiri constituens, quem e duobus attentius cauere debuisset, ut hunc
  saltem uno ferri impulsu contingeret. Quem Wermundus imbecillitatis uitio
  tantam recipiendorum ictuum patientiam præstare existimans, paulatim in
  occiduam pontis oram mortis cupiditate se protrahit, si de filio actum
  foret, fatum precipitio petiturus. Tanta sanguinis caritate flagrantem
  senem fortuna protexit. Uffo siquidem filium regis ad secum auidius
  decernendum hortatus, claritatem generis ab ipso conspicuo fortitudinis
  opere æquari iubet, ne rege ortum plebeius comes uirtute præstare
  uideatur. Athletam deinde, explorandæ eius fortitudinis gratia, ne domini
  sui terga timidius subsequeretur, admonitum fiduciam a regis filio in se
  repositam egregiis dimicationis operibus pensare præcepit, cuius delectu
  unicus pugnæ comes adscitus fuerit. Obtemperantem illum propiusque
  congredi rubore compulsum, primo ferri ictu medium dissecat. Quo sono
  recreatus Wermundus, filii ferrum audire se dixit, rogatque, cui
  potissimum parti ictum inflixerit. Referentibus deinde ministris, eum non
  unam corporis partem, sed totam hominis transegisse compagem, abstractum
  præcipitio corpus ponti restituit, eodem studio lucem expetens, quo fatum
  optauerat. Tum Uffo, reliquum hostem prioris exemplo consumere cupiens,
  regis filium ad ultionem interfecti pro se satellitis manibus
  parentationis loco erogandam impensioribus uerbis sollicitat. Quem
  propius accedere sua adhortatione coactum, infligendi ictus loco
  curiosius denotato, gladioque, quod tenuem eius laminam suis imparem
  uiribus formidaret, in aciem alteram uerso, penetrabili corporis sectione
  transuerberat. Quo audito Wermundus Screp gladii sonum secundo suis
  auribus incessisse perhibuit. Affirmantibus deinde arbitris, utrunque
  hostem ab eius filio consumptum, nimietate gaudii uultum fletu soluit.
  Ita genas, quas dolor madidare non poterat, lætitia rigauit. Saxonibus
  igitur pudore m&oelig;stis, pugilumque funus summa cum ruboris acerbitate
  ducentibus, Uffonem Dani iocundis excepere tripudiis. Quieuit tum
  Athislanæ cædis infamia, Saxonumque obprobriis expirauit.</p>

  <p>Ita Saxoniæ regnum ad Danos translatum, post patrem Uffo regendum
  suscepit, utriusque imperii procurator effectus, <!-- Page 211 --><span

<p class="cenhead">CAP. I.</p>

<p class="cenhead">De primo Rege Danorum.</p>

  <p>Skiold Danis primum didici præfuisse. Et ut eius alludamus uocabulo,
  idcirco tali functus est nomine, quia uniuersos regni terminos regiæ
  defensionis patrocinio affatim egregie tuebatur. A quo primum, modis
  Islandensibus, "Skioldunger" sunt reges nuncupati. Qui regni post se
  reliquit hæredes, Frothi uidelicet et Haldanum. Successu temporum
  fratribus super regni ambitione inter se decertantibus, Haldan, fratre
  suo interempto, regni monarchiam obtinuit. Hic filium, scilicet Helghi,
  regni procreauit hæredem, qui ob eximiam uirtutum strenuitatem, pyraticam
  semper exercuit. Qui cum uniuersorum circumiacentium regnorum fines
  maritimos classe pyratica depopulatus, suo subiugasset imperio, "Rex
  maris" est cognominatus. Huic in regno successit filius Rolf Kraki,
  patria virtute pollens, occisus in Lethra, quæ tunc famosissima Regis
  extitit curia, nunc autem Roskildensi uicina ciuitati, inter abiectissima
  ferme uix colitur oppida. Post quem regnauit filius eius Rökil cognomento
  dictus "Slaghenback." Cui successit in regno hæres, agilitatis
  strenuitate cognominatus, quem nostro uulgari "Frothi hin Frökni"
  nominabant. Huius filius et hæres regni extitit Wermundus, qui adeo
  prudentiæ pollebat uirtute, ut inde nomen consequeretur. Unde et
  "Prudens" dictus est. Hic filium genuit Uffi nomine, qui usque ad
  tricesimum ætatis suæ annum fandi possibilitatem cohibuit, propter
  enormitatem opprobrii, quod tunc temporis Danis ingruerat, eo quod in
  <!-- Page 212 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page212"></a>{212}</span>ultionem patris duo Dani in Sueciam
  profecti, patricidam suum una interemerunt. Nam et tunc temporis
  ignominiosum extitit improperium, si solum duo iugularent; præsertim cum
  soli strenuitati tunc superstitiosa gentilitas operam satagebat
  impendere. Præfatus itaque Wermundus usque ad senium regni sui gubernabat
  imperium; adeo tandem ætate consumptus, ut oculi eius præ senio
  caligarent. Cuius debilitatis fama cum apud transalpinas<a name="NtA340"
  href="#Nt340"><sup>[340]</sup></a> partes percrebuisset, elationis
  turgiditate Teotonica intumuit superbia, utpote suis nunquam contenta
  terminis. Hinc furoris sui rabiem in Danos exacuit Imperator, se iam
  Danorum regno conquisito sceptrum nancisci augustius conspicatus.
  Delegantur itaque spiculatores, qui turgidi principis jussa reportent
  præfato Danorum regi, scilicet Wermundo, duarum rerum præfigentes
  electionem, quarum pars tamen neutra extitit eligenda. Aut enim regnum
  jussit Romano resignare imperio, et tributum soluere, aut athletam
  inuestigare, qui cum Imperatoris campione monomachiam committere auderet.
  Quo audito, regis extitit mens consternata; totiusque regni procerum
  legione corrogata, quid facto opus sit, diligenti inquisitione
  percontabatur. Perplexam se namque regis autumabat autoritas, utpote cui
  et ius incumbebat decertandi, et qui regno patrocinari tenebatur. Uultum
  c&oelig;citas obnubilauerat, et regni heres elinguis factus, desidia
  torpuerat, ita ut in eo, communi assertione, nulla prorsus species
  salutis existeret. Nam ab infantia præfatus Uffo uentris indulgebat
  ingluuiei, et Epicuræorum more, coquinæ et cellario alternum officiose
  impendebat obsequium. Corrogato itaque c&oelig;tu procerum, totiusque
  regni placito<a name="NtA341" href="#Nt341"><sup>[341]</sup></a>
  celebrato, Alamannorum regis ambitionem explicuit, quid in hac optione
  haud eligenda facturus sit, indagatione cumulata senior sciscitatur. Et
  dum uniuersorum mens consternaretur angustia, cunctique indulgerent
  silentio, præfatus Uffo in media concione surrexit. Quem cum cohors
  uniuersa conspexisset, satis nequibat admirari, ut quid elinguis uelut
  orationi gestus informaret. Et quia omne rarum dignum nouimus
  admiratione, omnium in se duxit intuitum. Tandem sic orsus c&oelig;pit:
  "Non nos minæ moueant lacessentium, cum <!-- Page 213 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page213"></a>{213}</span>ea Teotonicæ
  turgiditati innata sit conditio, ut uerborum ampullositate glorientur,
  minarumque uentositate pusillanimes et imbecilles calleant comminatione
  consternare. Me etenim unicum et uerum regni natura produxit heredem, cui
  profecto nouistis incumbere, ut monomachiæ me discrimini audacter
  obiiciam, quatenus uel pro regno solus occumbam, uel pro patria solus
  uictoriam obtineam. Ut ergo minarum cassetur ampullositas, hæc Imperatori
  referant mandata, ut Imperatoris filius et heres imperii, cum athleta
  præstantissimo, mihi soli non formidet occurrere." Dixit, et hæc verba
  dictauit voce superba. Qui dum orationem complesset, a collateralibus
  senior sciscitabatur, cuiusnam hæc fuisset oratio? Cum autem a
  circumstantibus intellexisset, quod filius suus, prius veluti mutus, hunc
  effudisset sermonem, palpandum eum jussit accersiri. Et cum humeros
  lacertosque, et clunes, suras atque tibias, cæteraque membra organica
  crebro palpasset: "Talem," ait, "me memini in flore extitisse
  iuuentutis." Quid multa? Terminus pugnæ constituitur et locus. Talique
  responso percepto, ad propria legati repedabant.</p>

<p class="cenhead">CAP. II.</p>

<p class="cenhead">De duello Uffonis.</p>

  <p>Superest ergo, ut arma nouo militi congrua corrogentur. Allatisque
  ensibus, quos in regno præstantiores rex poterat inuestigare, Uffo
  singulos dextra uibrans, in partes confregit minutissimas. "Hæccine arma
  sunt," inquit, "quibus et uitam et regni tuebor honorem?" Cuius cum pater
  uiuidam experiretur uirtutem, "Unicum adhuc," ait, "et regni et uitæ
  nostræ superest asylum." Ad tumulum itaque ducatum postulauit, in quo
  prius mucronem experientissimum occultauerat. Et mox intersigniis per
  petrarum notas edoctus, gladium jussit effodi præstantissimum. Quem
  illico dextra corripiens, "Hic est," ait, "fili, quo numerose triumphaui,
  et qui mihi infallibile semper tutamen extitit." Et hæc dicens, eundem
  filio contradidit. Nec mora; terminus ecce congressioni præfixus arctius
  <!-- Page 214 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page214"></a>{214}</span>instabat. Tandem, confluentibus undique
  phalangis innumerabilibus, in Egdoræ fluminis mediamne<a name="NtA342"
  href="#Nt342"><sup>[342]</sup></a> locus pugnæ constituitur: ut ita
  pugnatores ab utriusque c&oelig;tus adminiculo segregati nullius
  opitulatione fungerentur. Teotonicis ergo ultra fluminis ripam in
  Holsatia considentibus, Danis uero citra amnem dispositis, rex pontis in
  medio sedem elegit, quatenus, si unigenitus occumberet, in fluminis se
  gurgitem præcipitaret, ne pariter nato orbatus et regno cum dolore
  superstes canos deduceret ad inferos. Deinde emissis utrinque pugilibus,
  in medio amne conuenerunt. Ast ubi miles noster egregius Uffo, duos sibi
  conspexit occurrere, tanquam leo pectore robusto infremuit, animoque
  constanti duobus electis audacter se opponere non detrectauit, illo
  cinctus mucrone, quem patrem supra meminimus occuluisse, et alterum
  dextra strictum gestans. Quos cum primum obuios habuisset, sic
  singillatim utrumque alloquitur, et quod raro legitur accidisse, athleta
  noster elegantissimus, cuius memoria in æternum non delebitur, ita
  aduersarios animabat ad pugnam: "Si te," inquit, "regni nostri stimulat
  ambitio, ut nostræ opis, potentiæque, opumque capessere uelis opulentias,
  comminus te clientem decet præcedere, ut et regni tui terminos
  amplifices, et militibus tuis conspicientibus, strenuitatis nomen
  nanciscaris." Campionem uero hunc in modum alloquitur: "Uirtutis tuæ
  experientiam jam locus est propagare, si comminus accesseris, et eam,
  quam pridem Alamannis gloriam ostendisti, Danis quoque propalare non
  cuncteris. Nunc ergo famam tuæ strenuitatis poteris ampliare, et egregiæ
  munificentiæ dono ditari, si et dominum præcedas, et clypeo defensionis
  eum tuearis. Studeat, quæso, Teotonicis experta strenuitas variis artis
  pugillatoriæ modis Danos instruere, ut tandem optata potitus uictoria,
  cum triumphi ualeas exultatione ad propria remeare." Quam quum complesset
  exhortationem, pugilis cassidem toto percussit conamine, ita ut, quo
  feriebat, gladius in duo dissiliret. Cuius fragor per uniuersum intonuit
  exercitum. Unde cohors Teotonicorum exultatione perstrepebat: sed contra
  Dani desperationis consternati tristitia, gemebundi murmurabant. Rex
  uero, ut audiuit, quod filii ensis dissiliuisset, in margine se pontis
  jussit <!-- Page 215 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page215"></a>{215}</span>locari. Uerum Uffo, subito exempto, quo
  cinctus erat, gladio, pugilis illico coxam cruentauit, nec mora, et caput
  pariter amputauit. Sic ergo ludus fortunæ ad instar lunæ uarius, nunc
  his, nunc illis successibus illudebat, et quibus iamiam exultatione
  fauebat ingenti, eos nouercali mox uultu, toruoque conspexit intuitu. Hoc
  cognito, senior jam confidentius priori se jussit sede locari. Nec jam
  anceps diu extitit uictoria. Siquidem Uffo ualide instans, ad ripam amnis
  pepulit hæredem imperii, ibique eum haud difficulter gladio iugulauit.
  Sicque duorum solus uictor existens, Danis irrogatam multis retro
  temporibus infamiam gloriosa uirtute magnifice satis aboleuit. Atque ita
  Alamannis cum improperii uerecundia, cassatisque minarum
  ampullositatibus, cum probris ad propria remeantibus, postmodum in pacis
  tranquillitate præcluis Uffo regni sui regebat imperium.</p>

<p class="cenhead">M. <span class="sc">Note on the Danish Chronicles</span></p>

  <p>The text of Saxo Grammaticus, given above, is based upon the
  magnificent first edition printed by Badius Ascensius (Paris, 1514). Even
  at the time when this edition was printed, manuscripts of Saxo had become
  exceedingly scarce, and we have now only odd leaves of <span
  class="scac">MS</span> remaining. One fragment, however, discovered at
  Angers, and now in the Royal Library at Copenhagen, comes from a <span
  class="scac">MS</span> which had apparently received additions from Saxo
  himself, and therefore affords evidence as to his spelling.</p>

  <p>Holder's edition (Strassburg, 1886) whilst following in the main the
  1514 text of Badius Ascensius, is accordingly revised to comply with the
  spelling of the Copenhagen fragments, and with any other traces of <span
  class="scac">MS</span> authority extant. I doubt the necessity for such
  revision. If the text were extant in MS, one might feel bound to follow
  the spelling of the MS, as in the case of the old English <span
  class="scac">MSS</span> of the <i>Vitae Offarum</i> below: but seeing
  that Saxo, with the exception of a few pages, is extant only in a 16th
  century printed copy, the spelling of which is almost identical with that
  now current in Latin text books, it seems a pity to restore conjecturally
  mediæval spellings likely <!-- Page 216 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page216"></a>{216}</span>to worry a student. Accordingly I have
  followed the printed text of 1514, modernizing a very few odd spellings,
  and correcting some obvious printers errors<a name="NtA343"
  href="#Nt343"><sup>[343]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>A translation of the first nine books of Saxo by Prof. O. Elton has
  been published by the Folk-Lore Society (No. <span
  class="sc">xxxiii</span>, 1893).</p>

  <p>Saxo completed his history in the early years of the 13th century. His
  elder contemporary, Sweyn Aageson, had already written a <i>Brief History
  of the Kings of Denmark</i>. Sweyn's <i>History</i> must have been
  completed not long after 1185, to which date belongs the last event he
  records. The extracts given from it (pp. 211-15) are taken from
  Langebek's collection, with modifications of spelling. Langebek follows
  the first edition (Stephanius, 1642); the <span class="sc">ms</span> used
  in this edition had been destroyed in 1728. <i>Cod. Arn. Mag. 33</i>,
  recently printed by Gertz, although very corrupt, is supposed to give the
  text of Sweyn's <i>History</i> in a form less sophisticated than that of
  the received text (see Gertz, <i>Scriptores Minores Historiæ Danicæ</i>,
  1917, p. 62). The <i>Little Chronicle of the Kings of Leire</i> is
  probably earlier than Sweyn's <i>History</i>. Gertz dates it c. 1170, and
  thinks it was written by someone connected with the church at Roskilde.
  It covers only the early traditional history. See above, pp. 17, 204.</p>

<p class="cenhead">N. <span class="sc">The <i>Life of Offa I</i>, with extracts from the <i>Life of Offa II</i>. Edited from two mss in the Cottonian Collection</span></p>

  <p>The text is given from <i>MS Cotton Nero D. I</i> (quoted in the

  Minor variations of B are not usually noted. The two <span

  <p>The <i>Nero</i> <span class="scac">MS</span> is the more elaborate of
  the two, and is adorned with very fine drawings. <i>Claudius</i>,
  however, offers occasionally a better text; it has been read by a
  corrector whose alterations&mdash;contrary to what is so often the ease
  in mediæval <span class="sc">mss</span>&mdash;seem to be
  authoritative.</p>

  <p>The <i>Lives of the Offas</i> were printed by Wats in his edition of
  Matthew Paris (1639-40) from <span class="scac">MS</span> A. Miss Rickert

<h2>PART III</h2>

<h3>THE FIGHT AT FINNSBURG</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section I. The <i>Finnsburg Fragment</i></span></p>

  <p>The <i>Finnsburg Fragment</i> was discovered two centuries ago in the
  library of Lambeth Palace by George Hickes. It was written on a single
  leaf, which was transcribed and published by Hickes: but the leaf is not
  now to be found. This is to be regretted for reasons other than
  sentimental, since Hickes' transcript is far from accurate<a
  name="NtA423" href="#Nt423"><sup>[423]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Fragment</i> begins and breaks off in the middle of a line: but
  possibly not much has been lost at the beginning. For the <!-- Page 246
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page246"></a>{246}</span>first lines of
  the fragment, as preserved, reveal a well-loved opening motive&mdash;the
  call to arms within the hall, as the watcher sees the foes approach. It
  was with such a call that the <i>Bjarkamál</i>, the poem on the death of
  Rolf Kraki, began: "a good call to work" as a fighting king-saint thought
  it<a name="NtA424" href="#Nt424"><sup>[424]</sup></a>. It is with a
  similar summons to business that the <i>Finnsburg Fragment</i> begins.
  The watchman has warned the king within the hall that he sees lights
  approaching&mdash;so much we can gather from the two and a half words
  which are preserved from the watchman's speech, and from the reply made
  by the "war-young" king: "This is not the dawn which is rising, but dire
  deeds of woe; to arms, my men." And the defending warriors take their
  posts: at the one door Sigeferth and Eaha: at the other Ordlaf and
  Guthlaf, and Hengest himself<a name="NtA425"
  href="#Nt425"><sup>[425]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Then the poet turns to the foes, as they approach for the attack. The
  text as reported by Hickes is difficult: but it seems that Garulf<a
  name="NtA426" href="#Nt426"><sup>[426]</sup></a> is the name of the
  warrior about to lead the assault on the hall. Another warrior, Guthere,
  whether a friend, kinsman, or retainer<a name="NtA427"
  href="#Nt427"><sup>[427]</sup></a> we do not know, is dissuading him,
  urging him not to risk so precious a life in the first brunt. But Garulf
  pays no heed; he challenges the champion on guard: "Who is it who holds
  the door?"</p>

  <p>"Sigeferth is my name," comes the reply, "Prince I am of the Secgan: a
  wandering champion known far and wide: many a woe, many a hard fight have
  I endured: from me canst thou have what thou seekest."</p>

  <p>So the clash of arms begins: and the first to fall is Garulf, son of
  Guthlaf: and many a good man round him. "The swords flashed as if all
  Finnsburg were afire."</p>

<p><!-- Page 247 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page247"></a>{247}</span></p>

  <p>Never, we are told, was there a better defence than that of the sixty
  champions within the hall. "Never did retainers repay the sweet mead
  better than his bachelors did unto Hnæf. For five days they fought, so
  that none of the men at arms fell: but they held the doors." After a few
  more lines the piece breaks off.</p>

  <p>There are many textual difficulties here. But these, for the most
  part, do not affect the actual narrative, which is a story of clear and
  straightforward fighting. It is when we try to fit this narrative into
  relationship with the <i>Episode</i> in <i>Beowulf</i> that our troubles
  begin. Within the <i>Fragment</i> itself one difficulty only need at
  present be mentioned. Guthlaf is one of the champions defending the hall.
  Yet the leader of the assault, Garulf, is spoken of as Guthlaf's son. Of
  course it is possible that we have here a tragic incident parallel to the
  story of Hildebrand and Hadubrand: father and son may have been separated
  through earlier misadventures, and now find themselves engaged on
  opposite sides. This would harmonize with the atmosphere of the
  <i>Finnsburg</i> story, which is one of slaughter breaking out among men
  near of kin, so that afterwards an uncle and a nephew are burnt on the
  same pyre. And it has been noted<a name="NtA428"
  href="#Nt428"><sup>[428]</sup></a> that Garulf rushes to the attack only
  after he has asked "Who holds the door?" and has learnt that it is
  Sigeferth: Guthlaf had gone to the opposite door. Can Garulf's question
  mean that he knows his father Guthlaf to be inside the hall, and wishes
  to avoid conflict with him? Possibly; but I do not think we can argue
  much from this double appearance of the name Guthlaf. It is possible that
  the occurrence of Guthlaf as Garulf's father is simply a scribal error.
  For, puzzling as the tradition of <i>Finnsburg</i> everywhere is, it is
  peculiarly puzzling in its proper names, which are mostly given in forms
  that seem to have undergone some alteration. And even if
  <i>G&#x16B;ðl&#x101;fes sunu</i> be correctly written, it is possible
  that the Guthlaf who is father of Garulf is not to be identified with the
  Guthlaf whom Garulf is besieging within the hall<a name="NtA429"
  href="#Nt429"><sup>[429]</sup></a>.</p>

<p><!-- Page 248 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page248"></a>{248}</span></p>

  <p>One or other of these rather unsatisfactory solutions must
  unfortunately be accepted. For no theory is possible which will save us
  from admitting that, according to the received text, Guthlaf is fighting
  on the one side, and a "son of Guthlaf" on the other.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section II. The Episode in <i>Beowulf</i></span></p>

  <p>Further details of the story we get in the <i>Episode</i> of
  <i>Finnsburg</i>, as recorded in <i>Beowulf</i> (ll. 1068-1159).</p>

  <p>Beowulf is being entertained in the court of the king of the Danes,
  and the king's harper tells the tale of Hengest and Finn. Only the main
  events are enumerated. There are none of the dramatic speeches which we
  find in the <i>Fragment</i>. It is evident that the tale has been reduced
  in scope, in order that it may be fitted into its place as an episode in
  the longer epic.</p>

  <p>The tone, too, is quite different. Whereas the <i>Fragment</i> is
  inspired by the lust and joy of battle, the theme of the <i>Episode</i>,
  as told in <i>Beowulf</i>, is rather the pity of it all; the legacy of
  mourning and vengeance which is left to the survivors:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>For never can true reconcilement grow</p>
      <p>Where wounds of deadly hate have struck so deep.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It is on this note that the <i>Episode</i> in <i>Beowulf</i> begins:
  with the tragic figure of Hildeburh. Hildeburh is closely related to both
  contending parties. She is sister to Hnæf, prince of the "Half-Danes,"
  and she is wedded to Finn, king of the Frisians. Whatever may be obscure
  in the story, it is clear that a fight has taken place between the men of
  Hnæf and those of Finn, and that Hnæf has been slain: probably by Finn
  directly, though perhaps by his followers<a name="NtA430"
  href="#Nt430"><sup>[430]</sup></a>. A son of Finn has also fallen.</p>

  <p>With regard to the peoples concerned there are difficulties. Finn's
  Frisians are presumably the main Frisian race, dwelling in and around the
  district still known as Friesland; for in the Catalogue of Kings in
  <i>Widsith</i> it is said that "Finn Folcwalding <!-- Page 249 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page249"></a>{249}</span>ruled the kin of the
  Frisians<a name="NtA431" href="#Nt431"><sup>[431]</sup></a>." Hnæf and
  his people are called Half-Danes, Danes and Scyldings; Hnæf is therefore
  presumably related to the Danish royal house. But, in no account which
  has come down to us of that house, are Hnæf or his father Hoc ever
  mentioned as kings or princes of Denmark, and their connection with the
  family of Hrothgar, the great house of Scyldings who ruled Denmark from
  the capital of Leire, remains obscure. In <i>Widsith</i>, the people
  ruled over by Hnæf are called "children of Hoc" (<i>H&#x14D;cingum</i>),
  and are mentioned immediately after the "Sea-Danes<a name="NtA432"
  href="#Nt432"><sup>[432]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p>Then there is a mysterious people called the <i>Eotens</i>, upon whom
  is placed the blame of the struggle: "Verily Hildeburh had little reason
  to praise the good faith of the Eotens." This is the typical
  understatement of Old English rhetoric: it can only point to deliberate
  treachery on the part of the Eotens. Our interpretation of the poem will
  therefore hinge largely upon our interpretation of this name. There have
  been two views as to the Eotens. The one view holds them to be Hnæf's
  Danes, and consequently places on Hnæf the responsibility for the
  aggression. This theory is, I think, quite wrong, and has been the cause
  of much confusion: but it has been held by scholars of great weight<a
  name="NtA433" href="#Nt433"><sup>[433]</sup></a>. The other view regards
  the Eotens as subjects <!-- Page 250 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page250"></a>{250}</span>of Finn and foes of Hnæf. This view has
  been more generally held, and it is, as I shall try to show, only along
  these lines that a satisfactory solution can be found.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The poet continues of the woes of Hildeburh. "Guiltless, she lost at
  the war those whom she loved, child and brother. They fell as was fated,
  wounded by the spear, and a sad lady was she. Not for naught did the
  daughter of Hoc [i.e. Hildeburh] bewail her fate when morning came, when
  under the sky she could behold the murderous bale of her
  kinsfolk...."</p>

  <p>Then the poet turns to the figure of Finn, king of the Frisians. His
  cause for grief is as deep as that of Hildeburh. For he has lost that
  body of retainers which to a Germanic chief, even as to King Arthur, was
  dearer than a wife<a name="NtA434" href="#Nt434"><sup>[434]</sup></a>.
  "War swept away all the retainers of Finn, except some few."</p>

  <p>What follows is obscure, but as to the general drift there is no
  doubt. After the death of their king Hnæf, the besieged Danes are led by
  Hengest. Hengest must be Hnæf's retainer, for he is expressly so called
  (<i>þ&#x113;odnes þegn</i>) "the king's thegn." So able is the defence of
  Hengest, and so heavy the loss among Finn's men, that Finn has to come to
  terms. Peace is made between Finn and Hengest, and the terms are given
  fully in the <i>Episode</i>. Unfortunately, owing to the confusion of
  pronouns, we soon lose our way amidst the clauses of this treaty, and it
  becomes exceedingly difficult to say who are the people who are alluded
  to as "they." This is peculiarly unlucky because here again the critical
  word <i>Eotena</i> occurs, but amid such a tangle of "thems" and "theys"
  that it is not easy to tell from this passage to which side the Eotens
  belong<a name="NtA435" href="#Nt435"><sup>[435]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>But one thing in the treaty is indisputable. In the midst of these
  complicated clauses, it is said of the Danes, the retainers <!-- Page 251
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page251"></a>{251}</span>of Hnæf, that
  they are not to be taunted with a certain fact: or perhaps it may be that
  they are not, when speaking amongst themselves, to remind each other of a
  certain fact. However that may be, what <i>is</i> clear is the
  <i>fact</i>, the mention of which is barred. Nothing is to be said of it,
  even though "<i>they were following the slayer (bana) of their lord,
  being without a prince, since they were compelled so to do</i>." Here, at
  least, are two lines about the interpretation of which we can be certain:
  and I shall therefore return to them. We must be careful, however, to
  remember that the word <i>bana</i>, "slayer," conveys no idea of fault or
  criminality. It is a quite neutral word, although it has frequently been
  mistranslated "murderer," and has thus helped to encourage the belief
  that Finn slew Hnæf by treachery. Of course it conveys no such
  implication: <i>bana</i> can be applied to one who slays another in
  self-defence: it implies neither the one thing nor the other.</p>

  <p>Then the poet turns to the funeral of the dead champions, who are
  burned on one pyre by the now reconciled foes. The bodies of Hnæf and of
  the son (or sons)<a name="NtA436" href="#Nt436"><sup>[436]</sup></a> of
  Hildeburh are placed together, uncle and nephew side by side, whilst
  Hildeburh stands by lamenting.</p>

  <p>Then, we are told, the warriors, deprived of their friends, departed
  to Friesland, to their homes and to their high-city.</p>

  <p>Hengest still continued to dwell for the whole of that winter with
  Finn, and could not return home because of the winter storms. But when
  spring came and the bosom of the earth became fair, there came also the
  question of Hengest's departure: but he thought more of vengeance than of
  his sea-journey: "If he might bring about that hostile meeting which he
  kept in his mind concerning the child (or children) of the Eotens." Here
  again the word <i>Eotena</i> is used ambiguously, but, I think, this time
  not without some indication of its meaning. It has indeed been urged that
  the child or children of the Eotens are Hnæf, and any other Danes who may
  have fallen with him, and that when it is said that Hengest keeps them in
  mind, it is meant that he is remembering his fallen comrades with a view
  to taking <!-- Page 252 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page252"></a>{252}</span>vengeance for them. But this would be a
  queer way of speaking, as Hengest and his living comrades would on this
  theory be also themselves children of the Eotens<a name="NtA437"
  href="#Nt437"><sup>[437]</sup></a>. We should therefore need the term to
  be further defined: "children of the Eotens <i>who fell at
  Finnsburg</i>." It seems far more likely, from the way in which the
  expression is used here, that the children of the Eotens are the people
  <i>upon</i> whom Hengest intends to take vengeance.</p>

  <p>Then, we are further told, Hunlafing places in the bosom of Hengest a
  sword of which the edges were well known amongst the Eotens. Here again
  there has been ambiguity, dispute and doubt. Hunlafing has been even
  bisected into a chief "Hun," and a sword "Lafing" which "Hun" is supposed
  to have placed in the bosom of Hengest (or of someone else). Upon this
  act of "Hun" many an interpretation has been placed, and many a theory
  built. Fortunately it has become possible, by a series of rather
  extraordinary discoveries, such as we had little reason to hope for at
  this time of day, to put Hunlafing together again. We now know (and this
  I think should be regarded as outside the region of controversy) that the
  warrior who put the sword into Hengest's bosom <i>was</i> Hunlafing. And
  about Hunlafing we gather, though very little, yet enough to help us. He
  is apparently a Dane, the son of Hunlaf, and Hunlaf is the brother of the
  two champions Guthlaf and Ordlaf<a name="NtA438"
  href="#Nt438"><sup>[438]</sup></a>. Now Guthlaf and Ordlaf, as we know
  from the <i>Fragment</i>, were in the hall together <!-- Page 253
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page253"></a>{253}</span>with Hengest:
  it was "Guthlaf, Ordlaf and Hengest himself" who undertook the defence of
  one of the doors against the assailants. Guthlaf and Ordlaf were
  apparently sons of the king of Denmark. As Scyldings they would be Hnæf's
  kinsmen, and accompanied him to his meeting with Finn. Hunlafing, then,
  is a nephew of two champions who were attacked in the hall, and it is
  possible, though we cannot prove this, that his father Hunlaf was himself
  also in the hall, and was slain in the struggle<a name="NtA439"
  href="#Nt439"><sup>[439]</sup></a>. At any rate, when Hunlaf's son places
  a sword in the bosom of Hengest, this can only mean one thing. It means
  mischief. The placing of the sword, by a prince, in the bosom of another,
  is a symbol of war-service. It means that Hengest has accepted
  obligations to a Danish lord, a Scylding, a kinsman of the dead Hnæf, and
  consequently that he means to break the troth which he has sworn to
  Finn.</p>

  <p>Further, we are told concerning the sword, that its edges were well
  known amongst the Eotens. At first sight this might seem, and to many has
  seemed, an ambiguous phrase, for a sword may be well known amongst either
  friends or foes. The old poets loved nothing better than to dwell upon
  the adornments of a sword, to say how a man, by reason of a fine sword
  which had been given to him, was honoured amongst his associates at
  table<a name="NtA440" href="#Nt440"><sup>[440]</sup></a>. But if this had
  been the poet's meaning here, he would surely have dwelt, not upon the
  edges of the sword, but upon its gold-adorned hilt, or its jewelled
  pommel. When he says the <i>edges</i> of the sword were well known
  amongst the Eotens, this seems to convey a hostile meaning. We know that
  the ill-faith of the Eotens was the cause of the trouble. The phrase
  about the sword seems therefore to mean that Hengest used this sword in
  order to take vengeance on the Eotens, presumably for their
  treachery.</p>

  <p>The <i>Eotenas</i>, therefore, far from being the men of Hnæf and
  Hengest, must have been their foes.</p>

  <p>Then the poet goes on to tell how "Dire sword-bale came upon the
  valiant Finn likewise." The Danes fell upon Finn at <!-- Page 254
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page254"></a>{254}</span>his own home,
  reddened the floor of his hall with the life-blood of his men, slew him,
  plundered his town, and led his wife back to her own people.</p>

  <p>Here the <i>Episode</i> ends.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section III. Möller's Theory</span></p>

  <p>Now our first task is to find what is the relation between the events
  told in the <i>Fragment</i> and the events told in the <i>Episode</i> in
  <i>Beowulf</i>. It can, I think, be shown that the events of the
  <i>Fragment</i> precede the events of the <i>Episode</i> in
  <i>Beowulf</i>; that is to say that the fight in the hall, of which we
  are told in the <i>Fragment</i>, is the same fight which has taken place
  before the <i>Episode</i> in <i>Beowulf</i> begins, the fight which has
  resulted in the slaughter over which Hildeburh laments, and which
  necessitates the great funeral described in the first part of the
  <i>Episode</i> (ll. 1108-24).</p>

  <p>How necessary it is to place the <i>Fragment</i> here, before the
  beginning of the <i>Episode</i>, will be best seen, I think, if we
  examine the theory which has tried to place it elsewhere.</p>

  <p>This is the theory, worked out elaborately and ingeniously by Möller<a
  name="NtA441" href="#Nt441"><sup>[441]</sup></a>, a theory which has had
  considerable vogue, and many of the assumptions of which have been widely
  accepted. According to Möller and his followers, the story ran something
  like this:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Finn, king of the Frisians, had carried off Hildeburh, daughter of
  Hoc (1076), probably with her consent. Her father Hoc seems to have
  pursued the fugitives, and to have been slain in the fight which ensued
  on his overtaking them. After the lapse of some twenty years, the
  brothers Hnæf and Hengest, Hoc's sons, were old enough to undertake the
  duty of avenging their father's death. They make an inroad into Finn's
  country."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Up to this, all is Möller's hypothesis, unsupported by any evidence,
  either in the <i>Fragment</i> or the <i>Episode</i>. It is based, so far
  as it has any real foundation, upon a mythical interpretation of Finn,
  and upon parallels with the Hild-story, the Gudrun-story, and a North
  Frisian folk-tale<a name="NtA442" href="#Nt442"><sup>[442]</sup></a>.
  Some of the <!-- Page 255 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page255"></a>{255}</span>parallels are striking, but they are not
  sufficient to justify Möller's reconstruction. The authenticity of large
  portions of the folk-tale is open to doubt<a name="NtA443"
  href="#Nt443"><sup>[443]</sup></a>: and these portions are vital to any
  parallel with the story of <i>Finnsburg</i>; whilst we have no right to
  read into the Finn story details from the Hild or Gudrun stories, unless
  we can show that they are really versions of the same tale: and this
  cannot be shown. Möller's suppositions as to the events before the
  <i>Episode</i> in <i>Beowulf</i> opens, must therefore be dismissed.
  Möller's reconstruction then gets into relation with the real story, as
  narrated in <i>Beowulf</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A battle takes place in which many warriors, among them Hnæf and a
  son of Finn (1074, 1079, 1115), are killed. Peace is therefore solemnly
  concluded, and the slain warriors are burnt (1068-1124).</p>

  <p>As the year is too far advanced for Hengest to return home (ll. 1130
  ff.), he and those of his men who survive remain for the winter in the
  Frisian country with Finn. But Hengest's thoughts dwell constantly on the
  death of his brother Hnæf, and he would gladly welcome any excuse to
  break the peace which has been sworn by both parties. His ill-concealed
  desire for revenge is noticed by the Frisians, who anticipate it by
  themselves taking the initiative and attacking Hengest and his men whilst
  they are sleeping in the hall. <i>This is the night attack described in
  the Fragment.</i> It would seem that after a brave and desperate
  resistance Hengest himself falls in this fight<a name="NtA444"
  href="#Nt444"><sup>[444]</sup></a>, but two of his retainers, Guthlaf and
  Oslaf<a href="#Nt444"><sup>[444]</sup></a>, succeed in cutting their way
  through their enemies and in escaping to their own land. They return with
  fresh troops, attack and slay Finn, and carry his queen Hildeburh off
  with them (1125-1159)<a name="NtA445"
  href="#Nt445"><sup>[445]</sup></a>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now the difficulties of this theory will, I think, be found to be
  insuperable. Let us look at some of them.</p>

  <p>Möller's view rests upon his interpretation of the Eotens as the men
  of Hnæf<a name="NtA446" href="#Nt446"><sup>[446]</sup></a>. Since the
  Eotens are the aggressors, he <i>has</i> consequently to invent the
  opening, which makes Hnæf and Hengest the invaders of Finn's country: and
  he <i>has</i> therefore to relegate the <i>Fragment</i> (in which Hnæf's
  men are clearly not the attacking party but the attacked) to a later
  stage in the story. But we have already seen that this interpretation of
  the Eotens as the men of Hnæf is not the natural one.</p>

  <p>Further, the assumption that Hnæf and Hengest are brothers, though
  still frequently met with<a name="NtA447"
  href="#Nt447"><sup>[447]</sup></a>, is surely not justifiable. <!-- Page
  256 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page256"></a>{256}</span>There is
  nothing which demands any such relationship, and there is much which
  definitely excludes it. <i>After Hnæf's death</i>, Hengest is described
  as the thegn of Hnæf: an expression without parallel or explanation, if
  he was really his brother and successor. Again, we are expressly told in
  the <i>Episode</i> that the Danish retainers make terms with Finn, <i>the
  slayer of their lord, being without a prince</i>. How could this be said,
  if Hengest was now their lord and prince? These lines are, as we have
  seen, one of the few clear and indisputable things in the poem. An
  interpretation which contradicts them flatly, by making Hengest the lord
  of the Danish retainers, seems self-condemned.</p>

  <p>Again, in <i>Beowulf</i>, the poet dwells upon the blameless sorrows
  of Hildeburh. We gather that she wakes up in the morning to find that the
  kinsfolk whom she loves have, during the night, come to blows. "Innocent,
  she lost son and brother<a name="NtA448"
  href="#Nt448"><sup>[448]</sup></a>&mdash;a sad lady she." Are such
  expressions natural, if Hildeburh had eloped with Finn, and her father
  had in consequence been slain by him some twenty years before? If she has
  taken that calmly, and continued to live happily with Finn, would her
  equanimity be so seriously disturbed by the slaughter of a brother in
  addition?</p>

  <p>But these difficulties are nothing compared to the further
  difficulties which Möller's adherents have to face when they proceed to
  find a place for the night attack as told in the <i>Fragment</i>, in the
  middle of the <i>Episode</i> in <i>Beowulf</i>, i.e. between lines 1145
  and 1146. In the first place we have no right to postulate that such
  important events could have been passed over in silence in the summary of
  the story as given in <i>Beowulf</i>. For Möller has to assume that after
  the reconciliation between Hengest and Finn, Finn broke his pledges,
  attacked Hengest by night, slew most of the men who were with him,
  including perhaps Hengest himself; and that the <i>Beowulf</i>-poet
  nevertheless omitted all reference to these events, though they occur in
  the midst of the story, and are essential to an understanding of it.</p>

  <p>But even apart from this initial difficulty, we find that by no
  process of explaining <i>can</i> we make the night attack narrated <!--
  Page 257 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page257"></a>{257}</span>in
  the <i>Fragment</i> fit in at the point where Möller places it. In the
  night attack the men are called to arms by a "war-young king." This
  "war-young king" cannot be, as Möller supposes, Hengest, for the simple
  reason that Hengest, as I have tried to show above, far from being the
  brother of Hnæf, and his successor as king, is his servant and thegn. The
  king can only be Hnæf. But Hnæf has already been slain before the
  <i>Episode</i> begins: and this makes it impossible to place the
  <i>Fragment</i> (in which Hnæf appears) in the middle of the
  <i>Episode</i>. Further, it is said in the <i>Fragment</i> that never did
  retainers repay a lord better than did his men repay Hnæf. Now these
  words would only be possible if the retainers were fighting for their
  lord; that is, either defending him alive or avenging him dead. But
  Möller's theory assumes that we are dealing with a period when the
  retainers have definitely left the service of their lord Hnæf, after his
  death, and have entered the service of his slayer, Finn. They have thus
  dissolved all bonds with their former lord: they have taken Finn's money
  and become <i>his</i> men. If Finn then turns upon his new retainers and
  treacherously tries to slay them, it might be said that the retainers
  defended their own lives stoutly: but it would be far-fetched to say that
  in doing so they repaid their lord Hnæf. Their lord, according to
  Möller's view, is no longer Hnæf, but Finn, who is seeking their
  lives.</p>

  <p>Against such difficulties as these it is impossible to make headway,
  and we must therefore turn to some more possible view of the situation<a
  name="NtA449" href="#Nt449"><sup>[449]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section IV. Bugge's Theory</span></p>

  <p>Let us therefore examine the second theory, which is more particularly
  associated with the name of Bugge, though it was the current theory
  before his time, and has been generally accepted since.</p>

  <p>According to this view, the <i>Eotenas</i> are the men of Finn, and
  since upon them is placed the blame for the trouble, it <!-- Page 258
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page258"></a>{258}</span>must be Finn
  that makes a treacherous attack upon his wife's brother Hnæf, who is his
  guest in Finnsburg<a name="NtA450" href="#Nt450"><sup>[450]</sup></a>.
  This is the fight of which the <i>Fragment</i> gives us the beginning.
  Hnæf is slain, and then follow the events as narrated in the
  <i>Episode</i>: the treaty which Finn makes with Hengest, the leader of
  the survivors: and the ultimate vengeance taken upon Finn by these
  survivors.</p>

  <p>Here I think we are getting nearer to facts, nearer to a view which
  can command general acceptance: at any rate, in so far as the fight
  narrated in the <i>Fragment</i> is placed before the beginning of the
  <i>Episode</i> in <i>Beowulf</i>. Positive evidence that this is the
  right place for the <i>Fragment</i> is scanty, yet not altogether
  lacking. After all, the fight in the <i>Fragment</i> is a night attack,
  and the fight which precedes the <i>Episode</i> in <i>Beowulf</i>, as I
  have tried to show, is a night attack<a name="NtA451"
  href="#Nt451"><sup>[451]</sup></a>. But our reason for putting the
  <i>Fragment</i> before the commencement of the <i>Episode</i> is mainly
  negative: it lies in the insuperable difficulties which meet us when we
  try to place it anywhere else.</p>

  <p>But, it will be objected, there are difficulties also in placing the
  <i>Fragment</i> before the <i>Episode</i>. Perhaps: but I do not think
  these difficulties will be found to survive examination.</p>

  <p>The first objection to supposing that the <i>Fragment</i> narrates the
  same fight as precedes the <i>Episode</i> is, that the fight in the
  <i>Fragment</i> takes place at Finnsburg<a name="NtA452"
  href="#Nt452"><sup>[452]</sup></a>, whilst the fight which precedes the
  <i>Episode</i> apparently takes place away from Finn's capital: for after
  the fighting is over, the dead burned, and the treaty made, the warriors
  depart "to see Friesland, their homes, and their high-town
  (<i>h&#x113;a-burh</i>)<a name="NtA453"
  href="#Nt453"><sup>[453]</sup></a>."</p>

<p><!-- Page 259 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page259"></a>{259}</span></p>

  <p>But I do not see that this involves us in any difficulty. It is surely
  quite reasonable that Finnsburg&mdash;Finn's castle&mdash;where the first
  fight takes place, is not, and was never meant to be, the same as Finn's
  capital, his <i>h&#x113;aburh</i>, his "own home." After all, when a
  king's name is given to a town, the presumption is rather that the town
  is <i>not</i> his capital, but some new settlement built in a newly
  acquired territory. <i>&#x112;adwinesburh</i> was not the capital of King
  Eadwine: it was the stronghold which he held against the Picts on the
  outskirts of his realm. Aosta was not the capital of Augustus, nor Fort
  William of William III, nor Harounabad of Haroun al Raschid. So here: we
  know that the chief town of the Frisians was not Finnsburg, but Dorestad:
  "Dorostates of the Frisians<a name="NtA454"
  href="#Nt454"><sup>[454]</sup></a>." The fight may have taken place at
  some outlying castle built by Finn, and named after him <i>Finnsburg</i>:
  then he returned, we are told, to his <i>h&#x113;aburh</i>: and it is
  here, <i>æt his sylfes h&#x101;m</i>, "in his own home" (the poet himself
  seems to emphasize a distinction) that destruction in the end comes upon
  him. There is surely no difficulty here.</p>

  <p>A second discrepancy has often been indicated. In the <i>Fragment</i>
  the fight lasts five days before any one of the defenders fall: in the
  <i>Episode</i> (it is argued) Hildeburh in the morning finds her brother
  slain<a name="NtA455" href="#Nt455"><sup>[455]</sup></a>. Even were this
  so, I do not know that it need trouble us much. In a detail like this,
  which <!-- Page 260 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page260"></a>{260}</span>does not go to the heart of the story,
  there might easily be a discrepancy between two versions<a name="NtA456"
  href="#Nt456"><sup>[456]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>But the whole difficulty merely arises from reading more into the
  words of the <i>Episode</i> than the text will warrant. It is not
  asserted in the <i>Episode</i> that Hildeburh found her kinsfolk dead in
  the morning, but that in the morning she found "murderous bale amid her
  kinsfolk." Hildeburh woke up to find a fight in progress: how long it
  went on, the <i>Episode</i> does not say: but that it was prolonged we
  gather from ll. 1080-5: and there is no reason why the deadly strife
  which Hildeburh found in the morning might not have lasted five days or
  more, before it culminated in the death of Hnæf.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, the commander in the <i>Fragment</i> is called a "war-young
  king." This, it has been said, is inapplicable to Hnæf, since he is
  brother of Hildeburh, who is old enough to have a son slain in the
  combat.</p>

  <p>But an uncle may be very young. Beowulf speaks of his uncle Hygelac as
  young, even though he seems to imply that his own youth is partly past<a
  name="NtA457" href="#Nt457"><sup>[457]</sup></a>. And no advantage, but
  the reverse, is gained, even in this point, if, following Möller's
  hypothesis, and assuming that the fight narrated in the <i>Fragment</i>
  takes place after the treaty with Finn, we make the "war-young king"
  Hengest. For those who, with Möller, suppose Hengest to be brother of
  Hnæf, will have to admit the avuncular difficulty in him also.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section V. Some Difficulties in Bugge's Theory</span></p>

  <p>We may then, I think, accept as certain, that first come the events
  narrated in the <i>Fragment</i>, then those told in the <i>Episode</i> in
  <i>Beowulf</i>. But we are not out of our troubles yet. There are
  difficulties in Bugge's view which have still to be faced.</p>

  <p>The cause of the struggle, according to Bugge and his adherents, is a
  treacherous attack made by Finn upon his <!-- Page 261 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page261"></a>{261}</span>brother-in-law Hnæf.
  According to the <i>Episode</i>, it is the Eotens who are treacherous; so
  Eotens must be another name for the Frisians.</p>

  <p>The word occurs three times in the genitive, <i>Eotena</i>; once in
  the dative, <i>Eotenum</i>: as a common noun it means "giant," "monster":
  earlier in <i>Beowulf</i> it is applied to Grendel and to the other
  misbegotten creatures descended from Cain. But how "giant" can be applied
  to the Frisians, or to either of the contending parties in the Finnsburg
  fight, remains inexplicable<a name="NtA458"
  href="#Nt458"><sup>[458]</sup></a>. <i>Eotena</i> must rather be the name
  of some tribe. But what tribe? The only people of whom we know,
  possessing a name at all like this, are the people who colonized Kent,
  whom Bede calls Jutes, but whose name would in Anglian be in the genitive
  <i>&#x112;otna</i>, but in the dative <i>&#x112;otum</i>, or perhaps
  occasionally <i>&#x112;otnum</i>, <i>&#x112;otenum</i><a name="NtA459"
  href="#Nt459"><sup>[459]</sup></a>. Now a scribe transliterating a poem
  from an Anglian dialect into West-Saxon should, of course, have altered
  these forms into the corresponding West-Saxon forms <i>&#x232;tena</i>
  and <i>&#x232;tum</i>. But nothing would have been more likely than that
  he would have misunderstood the tribal name as a common noun, and
  retained the Anglian forms (altering <i>eotum</i> or <i>eotnum</i> into
  <i>eotenum</i>) supposing the word to mean "giants." After all, the
  common noun <i>eotenum</i>, "giants," was quite as like the tribal name
  <i>&#x112;otum</i>, which the scribe presumably had before him, as was
  the correct West-Saxon form of that name, <i>&#x232;tum</i>.</p>

  <p>It is difficult therefore to avoid the conclusion that the "Eotens"
  are Jutes: and this is confirmed by three other pieces of evidence, not
  convincing in themselves, but helpful as subsidiary arguments<a
  name="NtA460" href="#Nt460"><sup>[460]</sup></a>.</p>

<p><!-- Page 262 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page262"></a>{262}</span></p>

  <p>(1) We should gather from <i>Widsith</i> that the Jutes were concerned
  in the <i>Finnsburg</i> business. For in that poem generally (though not
  always) tribes connected in story are grouped together; and the Jutes and
  Frisians are so coupled:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i16">&#x232;tum [weold] Gefwulf</p>
      <p>Fin Folcwalding Fr&#x113;sna cynne.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>(2) There is another passage in <i>Beowulf</i> in which <i>Eotenas</i>
  is possibly used in the sense of "Jutes."</p>

  <p>We have seen above<a name="NtA461" href="#Nt461"><sup>[461]</sup></a>
  that according to a Scandinavian tradition Lotherus was exiled <i>in
  Jutiam</i>: and Heremod, who has been held to be the counterpart of
  Lotherus</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i16"><i>mid Eotenum</i> wearð</p>
      <p>on f&#x113;onda geweald forð forl&#x101;cen.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>But the identification of Lotherus and Heremod is too hypothetical to
  carry the weight of much argument.</p>

  <p>(3) Finn comes into many Old English pedigrees, which have doubtless
  borrowed from one another. But the earliest in which we find him, and the
  only one in which we find his father Folcwald, is that of the Jutish
  kings of Kent<a name="NtA462" href="#Nt462"><sup>[462]</sup></a>. Here,
  too, the name Hengest meets us.</p>

  <p>The view that the name "Eoten" in the <i>Finnsburg</i> story is a form
  of the word "Jute" is, then, one which is very difficult to reject. It is
  one which has in the past been held by many scholars and is, I think,
  held by all who have recently expressed any opinion on the subject<a
  name="NtA463" href="#Nt463"><sup>[463]</sup></a>. But this renders very
  difficult the assumption of Bugge and his followers that the word "Eoten"
  is synonymous with "Frisian<a name="NtA464"
  href="#Nt464"><sup>[464]</sup></a>." For Frisians were not Jutes. <!--
  Page 263 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page263"></a>{263}</span>The
  tribes were closely related; but the two words were not synonymous. The
  very lines in <i>Widsith</i>, which couple Jutes and Frisians together,
  as if they were related in story, show that the names were regarded as
  those of distinct tribes. And this evidence from <i>Widsith</i> is very
  important, because the compiler of that list of names clearly knew the
  story of Finn and Hnæf.</p>

  <p>But this is not the only difficulty in Bugge's interpretation of the
  Eotens as Frisians. The outbreak of war, we are told, is due to the
  treachery of the Eotens. This Bugge and his followers interpret as
  meaning that Finn must have treacherously attacked Hnæf. Yet the poet
  speaks of "the warriors of Finn when the sudden danger fell upon them":
  <i>þ&#x101; h&#x12B;&#x113; se f&#x1E3;r begeat</i>. It is essential to
  <i>f&#x1E3;r</i> that it signifies a sudden and unexpected attack<a
  name="NtA465" href="#Nt465"><sup>[465]</sup></a>: and the unexpected
  attack must have come, not upon the assailants but upon the assailed.</p>

  <p>Yet this difficulty, though it has been emphasized by Möller<a
  name="NtA466" href="#Nt466"><sup>[466]</sup></a> and other opponents of
  Bugge's view, is not insuperable<a name="NtA467"
  href="#Nt467"><sup>[467]</sup></a>, and I hope to show below that there
  is no real difficulty. But it leads us to a problem not so easily
  surmounted. If Finn made a treacherous attack upon Hnæf, and slew him,
  how did it come that Hengest, and Hnæf's other men, made terms with their
  murderous host?</p>

  <p>In the primitive heathen days it had been a rule that the retainer
  must not survive his vanquished lord<a name="NtA468"
  href="#Nt468"><sup>[468]</sup></a>. The ferocity of this rule was
  subsequently softened, and, in point of fact, we <i>do</i> often hear,
  after some great leader has been slain, of his followers accepting
  quarter from a chivalrous foe, without being <!-- Page 264 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page264"></a>{264}</span>therefore regarded as
  having acted disgracefully<a name="NtA469"
  href="#Nt469"><sup>[469]</sup></a>. But, if Finn had invited Hnæf and
  Hnæf's retainers to be his guests, and had fallen upon them by treachery,
  the action of the retainers in coming to terms with Finn, in entering his
  service, and stipulating how much of his pay they shall receive, would be
  contrary to all standards of conduct as understood in the Heroic Age, and
  would deprive Hnæf's men of any sympathy the audience might feel for
  them. But Hnæf's men are not censured: they are in fact treated most
  sympathetically in the <i>Episode</i>, and in the <i>Fragment</i>, at an
  earlier point in the story, they are enthusiastically applauded<a
  name="NtA470" href="#Nt470"><sup>[470]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>It is strange enough in any case that Hnæf's retainers should make
  terms with the slayer of their lord. But it is not merely strange, it is
  absolutely unintelligible, if we are to suppose that Finn has not merely
  slain Hnæf, but has lured him into his power, and then slain him while a
  guest.</p>

  <p>It is to the credit of Bugge that he felt this difficulty: but his
  attempt to explain it is hardly satisfactory. He fell back upon a
  parallel between the story of the death of Rolf Kraki and the story of
  <i>Finnsburg</i>. We have already seen that the resemblance is very close
  between the <i>Bjarkamál</i>, which narrates the death of Rolf, and the
  opening of the <i>Finnsburg Fragment</i>. The parallel which Bugge
  invoked comes from the sequel to the Rolf story<a name="NtA471"
  href="#Nt471"><sup>[471]</sup></a> which tells how Hiarwarus, the
  murderer of Rolf Kraki, astonished by the devotion of Rolf's retainers,
  lamented their death, and said how gladly he would have given quarter to
  such men, and taken them into his service. Thereupon Wiggo, the one
  survivor, who had previously vowed to avenge his lord, and had concealed
  himself with that object, came forward and offered to accept these terms.
  Accordingly he placed his hand upon the hilt of his new master's drawn
  sword, as if about to swear fealty to him: but instead of swearing, he
  ran him through.</p>

  <p>"Glorious and ever memorable hero, who valiantly kept his vow," says
  Saxo<a name="NtA472" href="#Nt472"><sup>[472]</sup></a>. Whether or no we
  share the exultation of <!-- Page 265 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page265"></a>{265}</span>that excellent if somewhat bloodthirsty
  ecclesiastic, we must admit that Wiggo's methods were sensible and
  practical. If, singlehanded, he was to keep his vow, and avenge his lord,
  he could only hope to do it by some such stratagem.</p>

  <p>Bugge tries to explain Hengest's action on similar lines: "He does not
  hesitate to enter the service of Finn in order thereby to carry out his
  revenge<a name="NtA473" href="#Nt473"><sup>[473]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p>But the circumstances are entirely different. Wiggo was left alone,
  the only survivor of Rolf's household, to face a whole army. But Hengest
  is no single survivor: he and his fellows have made so good a defence
  that Finn cannot overcome them by conflict on the <i>meðel-stede</i>. Not
  only so, but, if we accept the interpretation that almost every critic
  and editor has put upon the passage (ll. 1184-5), Hengest's position is
  even stronger. Finn has lost almost all his thegns; the usual
  interpretation puts him at the mercy of Hengest: at best it is a draw<a
  name="NtA474" href="#Nt474"><sup>[474]</sup></a>. If, then, Hengest wants
  vengeance upon Finn, why does he not pursue it? Instead of which,
  according to Bugge, he enters Finn's service in order that he may get an
  opportunity for revenge.</p>

  <p>And note, that Wiggo did not swear the oath of fealty to the murderer
  of his master Rolf: he merely put himself in the posture to do so, and
  then, instead, ran the tyrant through forthwith. But Hengest <i>does</i>
  swear the oath, and <i>does not</i> forthwith slay the tyrant. He spends
  the winter with him, receives a sword from Hunlafing, after which his
  name does not occur again. Finn is ultimately slain, but the names which
  are found in that connection are those of Guthlaf and Oslaf [Ordlaf].</p>

  <p>So Bugge's explanation comes to this: Hengest is fighting with success
  against Finn, but he refrains from vengeance: instead, he treacherously
  enters his service in order that he may take an opportunity of vengeance,
  which opportunity, however, it is never made clear to us that he
  takes.</p>

  <p>Had Hengest been a man of that kind, he would not have been a hero of
  Old English heroic song.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section VI. Recent Elucidations. Prof. Ayres' Comments</span></p>

  <p>It is one of the merits of Bugge's view&mdash;one of the proofs of its
  general soundness&mdash;that it admits of successive improvements at the
  hands of succeeding commentators. No one has done more in this way than
  has Prof. Ayres to clear up the story, particularly the latter part of
  the <i>Episode</i>. Ayres evolves unity out of what had been before "a
  rapid-fire of events that hit all around a central tragic situation and
  do not once touch it." Hengest does not, Ayres thinks, enter the service
  of Finn with any such well-formed plan of revenge as Bugge had attributed
  to him. Hengest was in a difficult situation. It is his mental conflict,
  "torn between his oath to Finn and his duty to the dead Hnæf," which
  gives unity to all that follows. It is a tragedy of Hengest, hesitating,
  like Shakespeare's Hamlet, over the duty of revenge. Prof. Ayres'
  statement here is too good to summarize; it must be quoted at length:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"How did he feel during that long, blood-stained winter? He naturally
  thought about home (<i>eard gemunde</i>, 1129), but there was no question
  of sailing then, no need yet of decision while the storm roared outside.
  By and by spring came round, as it has a way of doing. How did he feel
  then? Then, like any other Northerner, he wanted to put to sea:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i16">fundode wrecca,</p>
      <p>gist of geardum.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>That is what he would naturally do. He would speak to Finn and be off;
  in the spring his business was on the sea. That is all right as to Finn,
  but as to the dead Hnæf it is very like running away; it is postponing
  vengeance sadly. Will he prove so unpregnant of his cause as that? No;
  though he would like to go to sea, he thought <i>rather</i> of vengeance,
  and staid in the hope of managing a successful surprise against Finn and
  his people:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i16">h&#x113; t&#x14D; gyrn-wræce</p>
      <p>sw&#x12B;ðor þ&#x14D;hte&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; þonne t&#x14D; s&#x1E3;-l&#x101;de,</p>
      <p>gif h&#x113; torn-gem&#x14D;t&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; þurht&#x113;on mihte,</p>
      <p>þæt h&#x113; Eotena b&#x113;arn&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inne gemunde.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>All this says clearly that Hengest was thinking things over, whether
  he should or should not take vengeance upon Finn; it tells us also very
  clearly, with characteristic anticipation of the outcome of the story,
  that in the end desire for vengeance carried the day:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Sw&#x101; h&#x113; ne-forwyrnde&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; worold-r&#x1E3;denne,</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>he did not <i>thus</i> prove recreant to his duty. But we have not
  been told the steps by which Hengest arrived at his decision. That seems
  <!-- Page 267 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page267"></a>{267}</span>to be what we should naturally want to
  know at this point, and that is precisely what we are about to be told.
  Occasions gross as earth informed against him<a name="NtA475"
  href="#Nt475"><sup>[475]</sup></a>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Then Ayres goes on to explain the "egging," through the presentation
  of a sword by Hunlafing. This feature of the story is now pretty
  generally so understood; but Ayres has an interpretation of the part
  played by Guthlaf and Oslaf, which is new and enlightening.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Hengest's almost blunted purpose was not whetted by Hunlafing alone.
  The latter's uncles, Guðlaf and Oslaf [Ordlaf] took occasion to mention
  to Hengest the fierce attack (the one, presumably, in which Hnæf had
  fallen); cast up to him all the troubles that had befallen them ever
  since their disastrous sea-journey to Finnsburg; they had plenty of woes
  to twit him with:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>siððan grimne gripe&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; G&#x16B;ðl&#x101;f and &#x14C;sl&#x101;f</p>
      <p>æfter s&#x1E3;-s&#x12B;ðe&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sorge m&#x1E3;ndon,</p>
      <p>ætwiton w&#x113;ana d&#x1E3;l.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The effect of all this on Hengest is cumulative. Where he was before
  in perfect balance, he is now wrought to action by the words of his
  followers; he can control himself no longer; the balance is destroyed.
  The restless spirit (Hengest's in the first instance, but it may be
  thought of as referring to the entire attacking party, now of one mind)
  could no longer restrain itself within the breast:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i16">ne meahte w&#x1E3;fre m&#x14D;d</p>
      <p>forhabban in hreðre.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Vengeance wins the day<a name="NtA476"
  href="#Nt476"><sup>[476]</sup></a>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>By this interpretation Ayres has, as he claims, "sharpened some of the
  features" of the current interpretation of the Finn story. For, as he
  says, "in some respects the current version was very unsatisfactory;
  there seemed to be little relation between the presentation of the sword
  to Hengest and the spectacle of Guðlaf and Oslaf howling their complaints
  in the face of Finn."</p>

  <p>That Ayres' interpretation enhances the coherency of the story is
  beyond dispute: that it does so at the cost of putting some strain upon
  the text in one or two places may perhaps be urged<a name="NtA477"
  href="#Nt477"><sup>[477]</sup></a>. But that in its main lines it is
  correct seems to me certain: the story of Finnsburg is the tragedy of
  Hengest&mdash;his hesitation and his revenge. Keeping this well in view,
  many of the difficulties disappear.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

<p><!-- Page 268 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page268"></a>{268}</span></p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section VII. Problems still outstanding</span></p>

  <p>Many of the difficulties disappear: but the two big ones remain.
  Firstly, if "Eoten" means "Jute," as it is usually agreed that it does,
  why should the Frisians be called Jutes, seeing that a Frisian is not a
  Jute? Secondly, when Hengest and the other thegns of Hnæf enter the
  service of the slayer of their lord, they are not blamed for so doing,
  but rather excused, <i>þ&#x101; him sw&#x101; geþearfod wæs</i>. Such a
  situation is unusual; but it becomes incredible if that slayer, whose
  service they enter, had fallen upon and slain their lord by treachery,
  when his guest.</p>

  <p>It seems to me that neither of these difficulties is really inherent
  in the situation, but rather accidental, and owing to the way Bugge's
  theory, right enough in its main lines, has been presented both by Bugge
  and his followers. For it is not necessary to assume that Frisians
  <i>are</i> called <i>Eotenas</i> or Jutes. All that we are justified in
  deducing from the text is that Frisians and <i>Eotenas</i> are both under
  the command of Finn. If we suppose what the text demands, <i>and no
  more</i>, we are at one stroke relieved of both our difficulties. Though
  "Jute" can hardly have been synonymous with "Frisian," nothing is more
  probable, as I shall try to show<a name="NtA478"
  href="#Nt478"><sup>[478]</sup></a>, than that a great Frisian king should
  have had a tribe of Jutes subject to him, or should have had in his pay a
  band of Jutish mercenaries. Now if the trouble was due to these
  "Eotens"&mdash;and we are told that it was<a name="NtA479"
  href="#Nt479"><sup>[479]</sup></a>&mdash;our second difficulty is also
  solved. It would be much more natural for Hengest to come to terms with
  Finn, albeit the <i>bana</i> of his lord, if Finn's conduct had not been
  stained by treachery, and if the blame for the original attack did not
  rest with him.</p>

  <p>And, as I have said, there is nothing in the text which justifies us
  in assuming that <i>Eotenas</i> means "Frisians" and that therefore
  <i>Eotena tr&#x113;owe</i> refers to Finn's breach of faith. It has
  indeed been argued that <i>Eotenas</i> and Frisians are synonymous, <!--
  Page 269 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page269"></a>{269}</span>because in the terms of peace, whilst it
  is stipulated that Hengest and his comrades are to have equal control
  with the <i>Eotena bearn</i>, it is further stipulated that Finn is to
  give Hengest's men gifts equal to those which he gives to the
  <i>Fr&#x113;sena cynn</i><a name="NtA480"
  href="#Nt480"><sup>[480]</sup></a>. Here then <i>Eotena bearn</i> and
  <i>Fr&#x113;sena cynn</i> are certainly parallel, and are both contrasted
  with Hengest and his troops. But surely this in no wise proves <i>Eotena
  bearn</i> and <i>Fr&#x113;sena cynn</i> synonymous: they may equally well
  be different sections of Finn's host, just as in <i>Brunanburh</i> the
  soldiers of Athelstan are spoken of first as <i>Westseaxe</i>, and then
  as <i>Myrce</i>. Are we to argue that West-Saxons are Mercians? So in the
  account of Hygelac's fatal expedition<a name="NtA481"
  href="#Nt481"><sup>[481]</sup></a> the opponents are called Franks,
  Frisians, <i>H&#x16B;gas</i>, <i>Hetware</i>. A reader ignorant of the
  story might suppose these all synonymous terms for one tribe. But we know
  that they are not: the <i>Hetware</i> were the people immediately
  attacked&mdash;the Frankish overlord hastened to the rescue, and was
  apparently helped by the neighbouring Frisians, who although frequently
  at this date opposed to the Franks, would naturally make common cause
  against the pirate from overseas<a name="NtA482"
  href="#Nt482"><sup>[482]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>It was quite natural that the earlier students of the <i>Finnsburg
  Episode</i>, thinking of the two opposing forces as two homogeneous
  tribes, and finding mention of three tribal names, Danes, Eotens and
  Frisians, should have assumed that the Eotens must be exactly synonymous
  with <i>either</i> Danes <i>or</i> Frisians. But it is now recognized
  that the conditions of the time postulate not so much tribes as groups of
  tribes<a name="NtA483" href="#Nt483"><sup>[483]</sup></a>. In the
  <i>Fragment</i> we have, on the side of the Danes, <i>Sigeferth</i>,
  prince of the <i>Secgan</i>. The <i>Secgan</i> are not necessarily Danes,
  because their lord is fighting on the Danish side. Neither need the
  <i>Eotenas</i> be Frisians, because they are fighting on the Frisian
  side.</p>

  <p>We cannot, then, argue that two tribes are identical, because engaged
  in fighting a common foe: still less, because they are <!-- Page 270
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page270"></a>{270}</span>mentioned with
  a certain parallelism<a name="NtA484" href="#Nt484"><sup>[484]</sup></a>.
  And anyway, it is impossible to find in the use of the expression
  <i>Eotena bearn</i> in l. 1088 any support for the interpretation which
  makes <i>Eotena tr&#x113;owe</i> signify the treachery of Finn himself.
  For, assuredly, the proviso that Hengest and his fellows are to have half
  control as against the <i>Eotena bearn</i> does not mean that they are to
  have half control as against Finn himself. For the very next lines make
  it clear that they are to enter Finn's service and become his retainers.
  That Hengest and his men are to have equal rights with Finn's Jutish
  followers (<i>Eotena bearn</i>) is reasonable enough: but they obviously
  have not equal rights with Finn, their lord whom they are now to follow.
  <i>Eotena bearn</i> in l. 1088, then, does <i>not</i> include Finn: how
  <i>can</i> it then be used as an argument that <i>Eotena tr&#x113;owe</i>
  must refer to <i>Finn's</i> faith and his breach of it?</p>

  <p>Finn, then, is the <i>bana</i> of Hnæf, but there is nothing in the
  text which compels us to assume that he is the slayer of his guest.</p>

  <p>The reader may regard my zeal to clear the character of Finn as
  excessive. But it is always worth while to understand a good old tale.
  And it is only when we withdraw our unjust aspersions upon Finn's good
  faith that the tale becomes intelligible.</p>

  <p>This, I know, has been disputed, and by the scholars whose opinion I
  most respect.</p>

  <p>The poet tells us that Finn was the <i>bana</i> of Hnæf, so, says
  Ayres, "it is hard to see how it helps matters<a name="NtA485"
  href="#Nt485"><sup>[485]</sup></a>" to argue that Finn was not guilty of
  treachery. And Lawrence argues in the same way:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"How is it possible to shift the blame for the attack from Finn to the
  Eotenas when Finn is called the <i>bana</i> of Hnæf? It does not matter
  whether he killed him with his own hands or not; he is clearly held
  responsible; the lines tell us it was regarded as disgraceful for the
  <!-- Page 271 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page271"></a>{271}</span>Danes to have to follow him, and the
  revenge at the end falls heavily upon him. The insult and hurt to Danish
  pride would be very little lessened by the assumption that someone else
  started the quarrel; and for this assumption, too, the lines give no
  warrant<a name="NtA486" href="#Nt486"><sup>[486]</sup></a>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Let us take these objections in turn. I do not see how the fact that
  Finn is called the <i>bana</i> of Hnæf can prove <i>anything</i> as to
  "the blame for the attack." Of course the older editors may have thought
  so. Kemble translates <i>bana</i> "slaughterer," which implies brutality,
  and perhaps culpability. Bosworth-Toller renders <i>bana</i> "murderer,"
  which certainly implies blame for attack. But we know that these are mere
  mistranslations. Nothing as to "blame for attack" is implied in the term
  <i>bana</i>: "<i>bana</i> 'slayer' is a perfectly neutral word, and must
  not be translated by 'murderer,' or any word connoting criminality. A man
  who slays another in self-defence, or in righteous execution of the law,
  is still his 'bane'<a name="NtA487" href="#Nt487"><sup>[487]</sup></a>."
  Everyone admits this to be true: and yet at the same time <i>bana</i> is
  quoted to prove that Finn is to blame; because, for want of a better
  word, we half-consciously render <i>bana</i> "murderer": and "murderer"
  <i>does</i> imply blame. "Words," says Bacon, "as a Tartar's bow, do
  shoot back upon the understanding of the wisest."</p>

  <p>Lawrence continues: "The lines tell us that it was regarded as
  disgraceful for the Danes to have to follow him." But surely this is
  saying too much. That the Frisians are not to taunt the Danes with
  following the slayer of their lord is only one of two possible
  interpretations of the ll. 1101-3. And even if we accept this
  interpretation, it does not follow that the Danes are regarded as having
  done anything with which they can be <i>justly</i> taunted. It is part of
  the settlement between Gunnar and Njal, that Njal's sons are not to be
  taunted: if a man repeats the taunts he shall fall unavenged<a
  name="NtA488" href="#Nt488"><sup>[488]</sup></a>. Surely a man may be
  touchy about being taunted, without being regarded as having done
  anything disgraceful. Indeed, in our case, the poet implies that taunts
  would <i>not</i> be just, <i>þ&#x101; him sw&#x101; geþearfod wæs</i>.
  But, as I try to show below, no <i>þearf</i> could have excused the
  submission of retainers to a foe who had just slain their lord by
  deliberate treachery.</p>

<p><!-- Page 272 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page272"></a>{272}</span></p>

  <p>"The revenge at the end falls heavily upon Finn." It does; as so often
  happens where the feud is temporarily patched up, it breaks out again, as
  in the stories of Alboin, Ingeld or Bolli. But this does not prove that
  the person upon whom the revenge ultimately falls heavily had been a
  guest-slayer. The possibility of even temporary reconciliation rather
  implies the reverse.</p>

  <p>"The insult and hurt to Danish pride would be very little lessened by
  the assumption that someone else [than Finn] started the quarrel; and for
  this assumption, too, the lines give no warrant." But they <i>do</i>: for
  they tell us that it was due to the bad faith of the Eotens. Commentators
  may argue, if they will, that "Eotens" means Finn. But the weight of
  proof lies on them, and they have not met it, or seriously attempted to
  meet it.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section VIII. The Weight of Proof: The Eotens</span></p>

  <p>Finn is surely entitled to be held innocent till he can be proved
  guilty. And the argument for his guilt comes to this: the trouble was due
  to the bad faith of the Eotens: "Eotens" means "Jutes": "Jutes" means
  "Frisians": "Frisians" means "Finn": therefore the trouble was due to the
  treachery of Finn.</p>

  <p>Now I agree that it is probable that <i>Eotenas</i> means Jutes; and,
  as I have said, there is nothing improbable in a Frisian king having had
  a clan of Jutes, or a body of Jutish mercenaries, subject to him. But
  that the Frisians as a whole should be called Jutes is, <i>per se</i>,
  exceedingly improbable, and we have no shadow of evidence for it.
  Lawrence tries to justify it by the authority of Siebs:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Siebs, perhaps the foremost authority on Frisian conditions,
  conjectures that ... the occupation by the Frisians of Jutish territory
  after the conquest of Britain assisted the confusion between the two
  names."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But <i>did</i> the Frisians occupy Jutish territory? When we ask what
  is Siebs' authority for the hypothesis that Frisians occupied Jutish
  territory, we find it to be this: that because in <i>Beowulf</i> "Jute"
  means "Frisian," some such event must have taken place to account for
  this nomenclature<a name="NtA489" href="#Nt489"><sup>[489]</sup></a>. So
  it comes to this: the Frisians must have been called Jutes, because they
  occupied <!-- Page 273 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page273"></a>{273}</span>Jutish territory: the Frisians must have
  occupied Jutish territory because they are called Jutes. I do not think
  we could have a better example of what Prof. Tupper calls "philological
  legend."</p>

  <p>Siebs rejects Bede's statement, which places the Jutes in what is now
  Jutland: he believes them to have been immediately adjacent to the
  Frisians. For this belief that the Jutes were immediate neighbours of the
  Frisians there is, of course, some support, though not of a very
  convincing kind: but the belief that the Frisians occupied the territory
  of these adjacent Jutes rests, so far as I know, solely upon this
  identification of the <i>Eotenas</i>-Jutes with the Frisians, which it is
  then in turn used to prove.</p>

  <p>But if by Jutes we understand (following Bede) a people dwelling north
  of the Angles, in or near the peninsula of Jutland, then it is of course
  true that (at a much later date) a colony of Frisians <i>did</i> occupy
  territory which is near Jutland, and which is sometimes included in the
  name "Jutland." But, as I have tried to show above, this "North Frisian"
  colony belongs to a period much later than that of the Finn-story: we
  have no reason whatever to suppose that the Frisians of the Finn story
  are the North Frisians of Sylt and the adjoining islands and
  mainland&mdash;the <i>Frisiones qui habitabant Juthlandie</i><a
  name="NtA490" href="#Nt490"><sup>[490]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>And when we have assumed, without evidence, that, at the period with
  which we are dealing, Frisians had occupied Jutish territory, we are then
  further asked to assume that, from this settlement in Jutish territory,
  such Frisians came to be called Jutes. Now this is an hypothesis <i>per
  se</i> conceivable, but very improbable. Throughout the whole Heroic Age,
  for a thousand years after the time of Tacitus, Germanic tribes were
  moving, and occupying the territory of other people. During this period,
  how many instances can we find in which a tribe took the name of the
  people whose territory it occupied? Even where the name of the new home
  is adopted, the old tribal name is <i>not</i> adopted. For instance, the
  Bavarians occupied the territory of the Celtic Boii, but they did not
  call themselves Boii, but Bai(haim)varii, "the dwellers in the land of
  the Boii"&mdash;a very <!-- Page 274 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page274"></a>{274}</span>different thing. In the same way the Jutes
  who settled in the land of the Cantii did not call themselves
  <i>Kente</i>, but <i>Cantware</i>, "dwellers in Cantium." Of course,
  where the old name of a country survives, it does often <i>in the long
  run</i> come to be applied to its new inhabitants; but this takes many
  ages. It was not till a good thousand years after the English had
  conquered the land of the Britons, that Englishmen began to speak and
  think of themselves as "Britons." In feudal or 18th century days all the
  subjects of the ruler of Britain, Prussia, Austria, may come to be called
  British, Prussians, Austrians. But this is no argument for the period
  with which we are dealing. The assumption, then, that a body of Frisians,
  simply because they inhabited land which had once been inhabited by
  Jutes, should have called themselves Jutes, is so contrary to all we know
  of tribal nomenclature at this date, that one could only accept it if
  compelled by very definite evidence to do so. And of such evidence there
  is no scrap<a name="NtA491" href="#Nt491"><sup>[491]</sup></a>. Neither
  is there a scrap of evidence for the underlying hypothesis that any
  Frisians <i>were</i> settled at this date in Jutish territory.</p>

  <p>And as if this were not hypothetical enough, a further hypothesis has
  then to be built upon it: viz., that this name "Jutes," belonging to such
  of the Frisians as had settled in Jutish territory, somehow became
  applicable to Frisians as a whole. Now this might conceivably have
  happened, but only as a result of certain political events. If the Jutish
  Frisians had become the governing element in Frisia, it would be
  conceivable. But after all, we know something about Frisian history, and
  I do not <!-- Page 275 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page275"></a>{275}</span>think we are at liberty to assume any such
  changes as would have enabled the Frisian people, as a whole, to be
  called Jutes. How is it that we never get any hint anywhere of this
  Jutish preponderance and Jutish ascendancy?</p>

  <p>The argument that the "treachery of the Jutes" means the treachery of
  Finn, King of the Frisians, has, then, no support at all.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>One further argument there is, for attributing treason to Finn.</p>

  <p>It has been urged that in other stories a husband entraps and betrays
  the brother of his wife. But we are not justified in reading pieces of
  one story into another, unless we believe the two stories to be really
  connected. The Signy of the <i>V&#x1EB;lsunga Saga</i> has been quoted as
  a parallel to Hildeburh<a name="NtA492"
  href="#Nt492"><sup>[492]</sup></a>. Signy leaves the home of her father
  Volsung and her brother Sigmund to wed King Siggeir. Siggeir invites the
  kin of his wife to visit him, and then slays Volsung and all his sons,
  save Sigmund. But it is the difference of the story, rather than its
  likeness, which is striking. No hint is ever made of any possibility of
  reconciliation between Siggeir and the kin of the men he has slain. The
  feud admits of no atonement, and is continued to the utterance. Siggeir's
  very wife helps her brother Sigmund to his revenge.</p>

  <p>How different from the attitude of Sigmund and Signy is the
  willingness of Hengest to come to terms, and the merely passive and
  elegiac bearing of Hildeburh! These things do not suggest that we ought
  to read a King Siggeir treachery into the story of Finn.</p>

  <p>Again, the fact that Atli entices the brother of his wife into his
  power, has been urged as a parallel. But surely it is rather unfair to
  erect this into a kind of standard of conduct for the early Germanic
  brother-in-law, and to assume as a matter of course that, because Finn is
  Hnæf's brother-in-law, therefore he must have sought to betray him. The
  whole atmosphere of the Finn-Hnæf story, with its attempted
  reconciliation, is as opposed to that of the story of Atli as it is to
  the story of Siggeir.</p>

<p><!-- Page 276 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page276"></a>{276}</span></p>

  <p>The only epithet applied to Finn is <i>ferhð-freca</i>, "valiant in
  soul." Though <i>freca</i> is not necessarily a good word, and is applied
  to the dragon as well as to Beowulf, yet it denotes grim, fierce, almost
  reckless courage. It does not suggest a traitor who invites his foes to
  his house, and murders them by night.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>I interpret the lines, then, as meaning that the trouble arose from
  the Jutes, and, since the context shows that these Jutes were on Finn's
  side, and against the Danes, we must hold them to be a body of Jutes in
  the service of Finn<a name="NtA493"
  href="#Nt493"><sup>[493]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section IX. Ethics of the Blood Feud</span></p>

  <p>But, as we have seen, it is objected that this interpretation of the
  situation, absolving Finn from any charge of treachery or aggression,
  does not "help matters<a name="NtA494"
  href="#Nt494"><sup>[494]</sup></a>." Or, as Prof. Lawrence puts it, "the
  hurt to Danish pride [in entering the service of Finn] would be very
  little lessened by the assumption that someone else [than Finn] started
  the quarrel."</p>

  <p>These objections seem to me to be contrary to the whole spirit of the
  old heroic literature.</p>

  <p>I quite admit that there is a stage in primitive society when the act
  of slaying is everything, and the circumstances, or motives, do not
  count. In the Levitical Law, it is taken for granted that, if a man
  innocently causes the death of another, as for instance if his axe break,
  and the axe-head accidentally kill his comrade, then the avenger of blood
  will seek to slay the homicide, just as much as if he had been guilty of
  treacherous murder. To meet such cases the Cities of Refuge are
  established, where the homicide may flee till his case can be
  investigated; but even though found innocent, the homicide may be at once
  slain by the avenger, should he step outside the City of Refuge. And this
  "eye for eye" vengeance yields slowly: it took long to establish legally
  in our own country the distinction between murder and homicide.</p>

<p><!-- Page 277 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page277"></a>{277}</span></p>

  <p>For "The thought of man" it was held "shall not be tried: as the devil
  himself knoweth not the thought of man." Nevertheless, even the Germanic
  <i>wer-gild</i> system permits consideration of circumstances: it often
  happens that no <i>wer-gild</i> is to be paid because the slain man has
  been unjust, or the aggressor<a name="NtA495"
  href="#Nt495"><sup>[495]</sup></a>, or no <i>wer-gild</i> will be
  accepted because the slaying was under circumstances making settlement
  impossible.</p>

  <p>Doubtless in Germanic barbarism there was once a stage similar to that
  which must have preceded the establishment of the Cities of Refuge in
  Israel<a name="NtA496" href="#Nt496"><sup>[496]</sup></a>; but that stage
  had passed before the period with which we are dealing; in the Heroic Age
  the motive <i>did</i> count for a very great deal. Not but what there
  were still the literal people who insisted upon "an eye for an eye,"
  without looking at circumstances; and these people often had their way;
  but their view is seldom the one taken by the characters with whom the
  poet or the saga-man sympathises. These generally hold a more moderate
  creed. One may almost say that the leading motive in heroic literature is
  precisely this difference of opinion between the people who hold that
  under any circumstances it is shameful to come to an agreement with the
  <i>bana</i> of one's lord or friend or kinsman, and the people who are
  willing <i>under certain circumstances</i> to come to such an
  agreement.</p>

  <p>It happens not infrequently that after some battle in which a great
  chief has been killed, his retainers are offered quarter, and accept it;
  but I do not remember any instance of their doing this if, instead of an
  open battle, it is a case of a treacherous attack. The two most famous
  downfalls of Northern princes afford typical examples: after the battle
  of Svold, Kolbjorn Stallari accepts quarter from Eric, the chivalrous
  <i>bani</i> of his lord Olaf<a name="NtA497"
  href="#Nt497"><sup>[497]</sup></a>; but Rolf's men refuse quarter after
  the treacherous murder of their lord by Hiarwarus<a name="NtA498"
  href="#Nt498"><sup>[498]</sup></a>.</p>

<p><!-- Page 278 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page278"></a>{278}</span></p>

  <p>That men, after a fair fight, could take quarter from, or give it to,
  those who had slain their lord or closest kinsman, is shown by abundant
  references in the sagas and histories. For instance, when Eric, after the
  fight with the Jomsvikings, offers quarter to his prisoners, that quarter
  is accepted, even though their leaders, their nearest kin, and their
  friends have been slain. The first to receive quarter is young Sigurd,
  whose father Bui has just been killed: yet the writer obviously does not
  the less sympathize with Sigurd, or with the other Jomsviking survivors,
  and feels the action to be generous on the part of Eric, and in no wise
  base on the part of the Jomsvikings<a name="NtA499"
  href="#Nt499"><sup>[499]</sup></a>. But this is natural, because the
  Jomsvikings have just been defeated by Eric in fair fight. It would be
  impossible, if Eric were represented as a traitor, slaying the
  Jomsvikings by a treacherous attack, whilst they were his guests. Is it
  to be supposed that Sigurd, under such circumstances, would have taken
  quarter from the slayer of Bui his father?</p>

  <p>In the <i>Laxdæla Saga</i>, Olaf the Peacock, in exacting vengeance
  for the slaying of his son Kjartan, shows no leniency towards the sons of
  Osvif, on whom the moral responsibility rests. But he accepts
  compensation in money from Bolli, who had been drawn into the feud
  against his will. Yet Bolli was the actual slayer of Kjartan, and he had
  taken the responsibility as such<a name="NtA500"
  href="#Nt500"><sup>[500]</sup></a>. And Olaf is not held to have lowered
  himself by accepting a money payment as atonement from the slayer of his
  son&mdash;on the contrary "he was considered to have grown in reputation"
  from having thus spared Bolli. But after Olaf's death, the feud bursts
  out again, and revenge in the end falls heavily upon Bolli<a
  name="NtA501" href="#Nt501"><sup>[501]</sup></a>, as it does upon
  Finn.</p>

  <p>On this question a fairly uniform standard of feeling will be found
  from the sixth century to the thirteenth. That it <i>does</i> make all
  the difference in composing a feud, whether the slaying from which the
  feud arises was treacherous or not, can be abundantly proved from many
  documents, from Paul the Deacon, and possibly earlier, to the Icelandic
  Sagas. Such composition of feuds may or may not be lasting; it may or may
  <!-- Page 279 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page279"></a>{279}</span>not expose to taunt those who make it; but
  the questions which arise are precisely these: Who started the quarrel?
  Was the slaying fair or treacherous? Upon the answer depends the
  possibility of atonement. There may be some insult and hurt to a man's
  pride in accepting atonement, even in cases where the other side has much
  to say for itself. But if the slaying has been fair, composition is felt
  to be possible, though not without danger of the feud breaking out
  afresh.</p>

  <p>Prof. Lawrence has suggested that perhaps, in the original version of
  the <i>Finnsburg</i> story, the Danes were reduced to greater straits
  than is represented to be the case in the extant <i>Beowulf Episode</i>.
  He thinks that it is "almost incomprehensible" that Hengest should make
  terms with Finn, if he had really reduced Finn and his thegns to such a
  degree of helplessness as the words of the <i>Episode</i> state. It seems
  to me that the matter depends much more upon the treachery or the honesty
  of Finn. If Finn was guilty of treachery and slaughter of his guests,
  then it <i>is</i> "unintelligible" that Hengest should spare him: but if
  Finn was really a respectable character, then the fact that Hengest was
  making headway against him is rather a reason why Hengest should be
  moderate, than otherwise. To quote the <i>Laxdæla Saga</i> again: though
  Olaf the Peacock lets off Bolli, the <i>bani</i> of his son Kjartan, with
  a money payment, he makes it clear that he is master of the situation,
  before he shows this mercy. Paradoxical as it sounds, it was often easier
  for a man to show moderation in pursuing a blood feud, just
  <i>because</i> he was in a strong position. It is so again in the <i>Saga
  of Thorstein the White</i>. But the adversary must be one who deserves to
  be treated with moderation.</p>

  <p>Of course it is quite possible that Prof. Lawrence is right, and that
  in some earlier and more correct version the Danes may have been
  represented as so outnumbered by the Frisians that they had no choice
  except to surrender to Finn, and enter his service, or else to be
  destroyed. But, whether this be so or no, all parallel incidents in the
  old literature show that their choice between these evil alternatives
  will depend upon whether Finn, the <i>bana</i> of their lord, slew that
  lord by deliberate and premeditated treachery whilst he was his guest, or
  whether he <!-- Page 280 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page280"></a>{280}</span>was embroiled with him through the fault
  of others, under circumstances which were perfectly honourable. If the
  latter is the case, then Hnæf's men <i>might</i> accept quarter. Their
  position is comparable with that of Illugi at the end of the <i>Grettis
  Saga</i><a name="NtA502" href="#Nt502"><sup>[502]</sup></a>. Illugi is a
  prisoner in the hands of the slayers of Grettir and he charges them with
  having overcome Grettir, when already on the point of death from a
  mortifying wound, which they had inflicted on him by sorcery and
  enchantment. The slayers propose to Illugi terms parallel to those made
  to the retainers of Hnæf. "I will give thee thy life," says their leader,
  "if thou wilt swear to us an oath not to take vengeance on any of those
  who have been in this business."</p>

  <p>Now, note the answer of Illugi: "That might have seemed to me a matter
  to be discussed, if Grettir had been able to defend himself, and if ye
  had overcome him with valour and courage; but now it is not to be looked
  for that I will save my life by being such a coward as art thou. In a
  word, no man shall be more harmful to thee than I, if I live, <i>for
  never can I forget how it was that ye have vanquished Grettir</i>. Much
  rather, then, do I choose to die."</p>

  <p>Now of course it would have been an "insult and hurt" to the pride of
  Illugi, or of any other decent eleventh century Icelander, to have been
  compelled to swear an oath not to avenge his brother, even though that
  brother had been slain in the most chivalrous way possible; and it would
  doubtless have been a hard matter, even in such a case, for Illugi to
  have kept his oath, had he sworn it. But the treachery of the opponents
  puts an oath out of the question, just as it must have done in the case
  of the followers of King Cynewulf<a name="NtA503"
  href="#Nt503"><sup>[503]</sup></a> or of Rolf Kraki, and as it must have
  done in the case of the followers of Hnæf, had the slaying of Hnæf been a
  premeditated act of treachery on the part of Finn.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Njáls Saga</i>, Flosi has to take up the feud for the slain
  Hauskuld. Flosi is a moderate and reasonable man, so the first thing he
  does is to enquire into the <i>circumstances</i> under which Hauskuld was
  slain. Flosi finds that the circumstances, and the outrageous conduct of
  the slayers, give him no choice <!-- Page 281 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page281"></a>{281}</span>but to prosecute the feud. So in the end
  he burns Njal's hall, and in it the child of Kari.</p>

  <p>Now to have burned a man's child to death might well seem a deed
  impossible of atonement. Yet in the end Flosi and Kari are reconciled by
  a full atonement, <i>the father of the slain child actually taking the
  first step</i><a name="NtA504" href="#Nt504"><sup>[504]</sup></a>. And
  all this is possible because Flosi and Kari recognise that each has been
  trying to play his part with justice and fairness, and that each is
  dragged into the feud through the fault of others. When Flosi has said of
  his enemy, "I would that I were altogether such a man as Kari is," we
  feel that reconciliation is in sight.</p>

  <p>Very similar is the reconciliation between Alboin and Thurisind in
  Longobard story, but with this difference, that here it is Alboin who
  seeks reconciliation by going to the hall of the man whose son he has
  slain, thus reversing the parts of Flosi and Kari; and reconciliation is
  possible&mdash;just barely possible.</p>

  <p>Again, when Bothvar comes to the hall of Rolf, and slays one of Rolf's
  retainers, the other retainers naturally claim full vengeance. Rolf
  insists upon investigating the <i>circumstances</i>. When he learns that
  it was his own man who gave the provocation, he comes to terms with the
  slayer.</p>

  <p>Of course it was a difficult matter, and one involving a sacrifice of
  their pride, for the retainers of Hnæf to come to any composition with
  the <i>bana</i> of their lord; but it is not unthinkable, if the quarrel
  was started by Finn's subordinates without his consent, and if Finn
  himself fought fair. But had the slaying been an act of premeditated
  treachery on the part of Finn, the atonement would, I submit, have been
  not only difficult but impossible. If the retainers of Hnæf had had such
  success as our poem implies, then their action under such circumstances
  is, as Lawrence says, "almost incomprehensible." If they did it under
  compulsion, and fear of death, then their action would be contrary to all
  the ties of Germanic honour, and would entirely deprive them of any
  sympathy the audience might otherwise have felt for them. Yet it is quite
  obvious that the retainers of Hnæf are precisely the people with whom the
  audience is expected to sympathise<a name="NtA505"
  href="#Nt505"><sup>[505]</sup></a>.</p>

<p><!-- Page 282 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page282"></a>{282}</span></p>

  <p>In any case, the feud was likely enough to break out again as it did
  in the case of Alboin and Thurisind, and equally in that of Hrothgar and
  Ingeld.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the different versions of the story of the feud between the
  house of Hrothgar and the house of Froda are very much to the point.</p>

  <p>Much the oldest version&mdash;probably in its main lines quite
  historical&mdash;is the story as given in <i>Beowulf</i>. Froda has been
  slain by the Danes in pitched battle. Subsequently Hrothgar, upon whom,
  as King of the Danes, the responsibility for meeting the feud has
  devolved, tries to stave it off by wedding his daughter Freawaru to
  Ingeld, son of Froda. The sympathy of the poet is obviously with the
  luckless pair, Ingeld and Freawaru, involved as they are in ancient
  hatreds which are not of their making. For it is foreseen how some old
  warrior, who cannot forget his loyalty to his former king, will stir up
  the feud afresh.</p>

  <p>But Saxo Grammaticus tells the story differently. Froda (Frotho) is
  treacherously invited to a banquet, and then slain. By this treachery the
  whole atmosphere of the story is changed. Ingeld (Ingellus) marries the
  daughter of his father's slayer, and, for this, the old version
  reproduced by Saxo showers upon him literally scores of phrases of scorn
  and contempt. The whole interest of the story now centres not in the
  recreant Ingeld or his wife of treacherous race, but in the old warrior
  Starkad, whose spirit and eloquence is such that he can bring Ingeld to a
  sense of his "vast sin<a name="NtA506"
  href="#Nt506"><sup>[506]</sup></a>," can burst the bonds of his iniquity,
  and at last compel him to take vengeance for his father.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Saga of Rolf Kraki</i> the story of Froda is still further
  changed. It is a tale not only of treachery but also of slaying of kin.
  Consequently the idea of any kind of atonement, however temporary, has
  become impossible; there is no hint of it.</p>

  <p>Now the whole atmosphere of the Hengest-story in <i>Beowulf</i> is
  parallel to that of the <i>Beowulf</i> version of the Ingeld-story:
  agreement is possible, though it does not prove to be permanent. There is
  room for much hesitation in the minds of Hengest and of Ingeld: they
  remain the heroes of the story. But if Finn had, as is usually supposed,
  invited Hnæf to his fort and then <!-- Page 283 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page283"></a>{283}</span>deliberately slain him
  by treachery, the whole atmosphere would have been different. Hengest
  could not then be the hero, but the foil: the example of a man whose
  spirit fails at the crisis, who does the utterly disgraceful thing, and
  enters the service of his lord's treacherous foe. The hero of the story
  would be some other character&mdash;possibly the young Hunlafing, who,
  loyal in spite of the treachery and cowardice of his leader Hengest, yet,
  remaining steadfast of soul, is able in the end to infuse his own courage
  into the heart of the recreant Hengest, and to inspire all the perjured
  Danish thegns to their final and triumphant revenge on Finn.</p>

  <p>But that is not how the story is presented.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section X. An Attempt at Reconstruction</span></p>

  <p>The theory, then, which seems to fit in best with what we know of the
  historic conditions at the time when the story arose, and which fits in
  best with such details of the story as we have, is this:</p>

  <p>Finn, King of Frisia, has a stronghold, Finnsburg, outside the limits
  of Frisia proper. There several clans and chieftains are assembled<a
  name="NtA507" href="#Nt507"><sup>[507]</sup></a>: Hnæf, Finn's
  brother-in-law, prince of the Hocings, the Eotens, and Sigeferth, prince
  of the Secgan; whether Sigeferth has his retinue with him or no is not
  clear.</p>

  <p>But the treachery of the Eotens causes trouble: they have some old
  feud with Hnæf and his Danes, and attack them by surprise in their hall.
  There is no proof that Finn has any share in this treason. It is
  therefore quite natural that in the <i>Episode</i>&mdash;although the
  treachery of the Eotens is censured&mdash;Finn is never blamed; and that
  in the <i>Fragment</i>, Finn has apparently no share in the attack on the
  hall, at any rate during those first five days to which the account in
  the <i>Fragment</i> is limited.</p>

  <p>The attack is led by Garulf (<i>Fragment</i>, l. 20), presumably the
  prince of the Eotens: and some friend or kinsman is urging Garulf not to
  hazard so precious a life in the first attack. And <!-- Page 284 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page284"></a>{284}</span>here, too, the
  situation now becomes clearer: if Garulf is the chief of the attacking
  people, we can understand one of his kinsmen or friends expostulating
  thus: but if he is merely one of a number of subordinates despatched by
  Finn to attack the hall, the position would not be so easily
  understood.</p>

  <p>Garulf, however, does not heed the warning, and falls, "first of all
  the dwellers in that land." The <i>Fragment</i> breaks off, but the fight
  goes on: we can imagine that matters must have proceeded much as in the
  great attack upon the hall in the <i>Nibelungen lied</i><a name="NtA508"
  href="#Nt508"><sup>[508]</sup></a>. One man after another would be drawn
  in, by the duty of revenge, and Finn's own men would wake to find a
  battle in progress. "The sudden bale (<i>f&#x1E3;r</i>) came upon them."
  Finn's son joins in the attack, perhaps in order to avenge some young
  comrade in arms; and is slain, possibly by Hnæf. Then Finn <i>has</i> to
  intervene, and Hnæf in turn is slain, possibly, though not certainly, by
  Finn himself. But Hengest, the thegn of Hnæf, puts up so stout a defence,
  that Finn is unable to take a full vengeance upon all the Danes. He
  offers them terms. What are Hengest and the thegns to do?</p>

  <p>Finn has slain their lord. But they are Finn's guests, and they have
  slain Finn's son in his own house. Finn himself is, I take it, blameless.
  <i>It is here that the tragic tension comes in.</i> We can understand
  how, even if Hengest had Finn in his power, he might well have stayed his
  hand. So peace is made, and all is to be forgotten: solemn oaths are
  sworn. And Finn keeps his promise honestly. He resumes his position of
  host, making no distinction between Eotens, Frisians and Danes, who are
  all, for the time at least, his followers.</p>

  <p>I think we have here a rational explanation of the action of Hengest
  and the other thegns of Hnæf, in following the slayer of their lord.</p>

  <p>The situation resembles that which takes place when Alboin seeks
  hospitality in the hall of the man whose son he has slain, or when Ingeld
  is reconciled to Hrothgar. Very similar, too, <!-- Page 285 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page285"></a>{285}</span>is the temporary
  reconciliation often brought about in an Icelandic feud by the feeling
  that the other side has something to say for itself, and that both have
  suffered grievously. The death of Finn's son is a set off against the
  death of Hnæf<a name="NtA509" href="#Nt509"><sup>[509]</sup></a>. But, as
  in the case of Alboin and of Ingeld, or of many an Icelandic Saga, the
  passion for revenge is too deep to be laid to rest permanently. This is
  what makes the figure of Hengest tragic, like the figure of Ingeld: both
  have plighted their word, but neither can keep it.</p>

  <p>The assembly breaks up. Finn and his men go back to Friesland, and
  Hengest accompanies them: of the other Danish survivors nothing is said
  for the moment: whatever longings they may have had for revenge, the poet
  concentrates all for the moment in the figure of Hengest.</p>

  <p>Hengest spends the winter with Finn, but he cannot quiet his
  conscience: and in the end, he accepts the gift of a sword from a young
  Danish prince Hunlafing, who is planning revenge. The uncles of
  Hunlafing, Guthlaf and Oslaf [Ordlaf], had been in the hall when it was
  attacked, and had survived. It is possible that the young prince's
  father, Hunlaf, was slain then, and that his son is therefore recognised
  as having the nominal leadership in the operations of vengeance<a
  name="NtA510" href="#Nt510"><sup>[510]</sup></a>. Hengest, by accepting
  the sword, promises his services in the work of revenge, and makes a
  great slaughter of the treacherous Eotens. Perhaps he so far respects his
  oath that he leaves the simultaneous attack upon Finn to Guthlaf and
  Oslaf [Ordlaf]. Here we should have an explanation of <i>swylce</i>: "in
  like wise<a name="NtA511" href="#Nt511"><sup>[511]</sup></a>"; and also
  an explanation of the omission of Hengest's name from the final act, the
  slaying of Finn himself. Hengest made the Eotens <!-- Page 286 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page286"></a>{286}</span>feel the sharpness of
  his sword: and in like wise Guthlaf and Oslaf conducted their part of the
  campaign. Of course this is only a guess: but it is very much in the
  manner of the Heroic Age to get out of a difficulty by respecting the
  letter of an oath whilst breaking its spirit&mdash;just as Hogni and
  Gunnar arrange that the actual slaying of Sigurd shall be done by
  Guttorm, who had not personally sworn the oath, as they had.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section XI. Gefwulf, Prince of the Jutes</span></p>

  <p>Conclusive external evidence in favour of the view just put forward we
  can hardly hope for: for this reason, amongst others, that the names of
  the actors in the Finn tragedy are corrupted and obscured in the
  different versions. Hnæf and Hengest are too well known to be altered:
  but most of the other names mentioned in the <i>Fragment</i> do not agree
  with the forms given in other documents. Sigeferth is the Sæferth of
  <i>Widsith</i>: the Ordlaf (correct) of the <i>Fragment</i> is the Oslaf
  of the <i>Episode</i>. The first Guthlaf is confirmed by the Guthlaf of
  the <i>Episode</i>: the other names, the second Guthlaf, Eaha and
  Guthere, we cannot control from other sources: but they have all, on
  various grounds, been suspected.</p>

  <p>Tribal names are equally varied. Sigeferth's people, the Secgan, are
  called Sycgan in <i>Widsith</i>. And he would be a bold man who would
  deny (what almost all students of the subject hold) that <i>Eotena,
  Eotenum</i> in the <i>Episode</i> is yet another scribal error: the
  copyist had before him the Anglian form, <i>eotna, eotnum</i>, and
  miswrote <i>eotena, eotenum</i>, when he should have written the
  West-Saxon equivalent of the tribal name, <i>&#x232;tena,
  &#x232;tum</i>&mdash;the name we get in <i>Widsith</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i12">&#x232;tum [weold] Gefwulf</p>
      <p>Fin Folcwalding Fr&#x113;sna cynne.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>But in <i>Widsith</i> names of heroes and tribes are grouped together
  (often, but not invariably) according as they are related in story.
  Consequently Gefwulf is probably (not certainly) a hero of the Finn
  story. What part does he play? If, as I have been trying to show, the
  Jutes are the aggressors, then, as their chief, Gefwulf would probably be
  the leader of the attack upon the hall. <!-- Page 287 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page287"></a>{287}</span></p>

  <p>This part, in the <i>Fragment</i>, is played by Garulf.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Now <i>G&#x101;rulf</i> is not <i>Gefwulf</i>, and I am not going to
  pretend that it is. But <i>G&#x101;rulf</i> is very near <i>Gefwulf</i>:
  and (what is important) more so in Old English script than in modern
  script<a name="NtA512" href="#Nt512"><sup>[512]</sup></a>. It stands to
  <i>Gefwulf</i> in exactly the same relation as <i>Hereg&#x101;r</i> to
  <i>Heorog&#x101;r</i> or <i>Sigeferð</i> to <i>S&#x1E3;ferð</i> or
  <i>Ordl&#x101;f</i> to <i>&#x14C;sl&#x101;f</i>: that is to say the
  initial letter and the second element are identical. And no serious
  student, I think, doubts that <i>Hereg&#x101;r</i> and
  <i>Heorog&#x101;r</i>, or <i>Sigeferð</i> and <i>S&#x1E3;ferð</i>, or
  <i>Ordl&#x101;f</i> and <i>&#x14C;sl&#x101;f</i> are merely corruptions
  of one name. And if it be admitted to be probable that <i>Gefwulf</i> is
  miswritten for <i>G&#x101;rulf</i>, then the theory that Garulf was
  prince of the Jutes, and the original assailant of Hnæf, in addition to
  being the only theory which satisfactorily explains the internal evidence
  of the <i>Fragment</i> and the <i>Episode</i>, has also powerful external
  support.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Section XII. Conclusion</span></p>

  <p>But, apart from any such confirmation, I think that the theory offers
  an explanation of the known facts of the case, and that it is the only
  theory yet put forward which does. It enables us to solve many minor
  difficulties that hardly otherwise admit of solution. But, above all, it
  gives a tragic interest to the story by making the actions of the two
  main characters, Finn and Hengest, intelligible and human: they are both
  great chiefs, placed by circumstances in a cruel position. Finn is no
  longer a treacherous host, plotting the murder of his guests, without
  even having the courage personally to superintend the dirty work: and
  Hengest is not guilty of the shameful act of entering the service of a
  king who had slain his lord by treachery when a guest. The tale of
  <i>Finnsburg</i> becomes one of tragic misfortune besetting great
  heroes&mdash;a tale of the same type as the stories of Thurisind or
  Ingeld, of Sigurd or Theodric.</p>

<p><!-- Page 288 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page288"></a>{288}</span></p>

<p class="cenhead">FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE</p>

  <p>It is now generally recognised that loose confederacies of tribes
  were, at the period with which we are dealing, very common. Lawrence says
  this expressly: "The actors in this drama are members of two North Sea
  tribes, or <i>rather groups of tribes</i><a name="NtA513"
  href="#Nt513"><sup>[513]</sup></a>"; and again<a name="NtA514"
  href="#Nt514"><sup>[514]</sup></a>: "At the time when the present poem
  was put into shape, we surely have to assume for the Danes and Frisians,
  not compact and unified political units, but groups of tribes held
  somewhat loosely together, and sometimes known by tribal names."</p>

  <p>This seems to me a quite accurate view of the political situation in
  the later Heroic Age. The independent tribes, as they existed at the time
  of Tacitus, tended to coalesce, and from such coalition the nations of
  modern Europe are gradually evolved. In the seventh and eighth centuries
  a great king of Northumbria or Frisia is likely to be king, not of one
  only, but of many allied tribes. I cannot therefore quite understand why
  some scholars reject so immediately the idea that the Eotens are not
  necessarily Frisians, but rather a tribe in alliance with the Frisians.
  For if, as they admit, we are dealing not with two compact units, but
  with two groups of tribes, why must we assume, as earlier scholars have
  done, that <i>Eotenas</i> must be synonymous either with Frisians or
  Danes? That assumption is based upon the belief that we <i>are</i>
  dealing with two compact units. It has no other foundation. I can quite
  understand Kemble and Ettmüller jumping at the conclusion that the Eotens
  <i>must</i> be identical with the one side or the other. But once we have
  recognised that confederacies of tribes, rather than individual tribes,
  are to be expected in the period with which we are dealing, then surely
  no such assumption should be made.</p>

  <p>I think we shall be helped if we try to get some clear idea of the
  nationalities concerned in the struggle. For to judge by the analogy of
  other contemporary Germanic stories, there probably is some historic
  basis for the <i>Finnsburg</i> story: and even if the fight is purely
  fictitious, and if Finn Folcwalding never existed, still the Old English
  poets would represent the fictitious Frisian king in the light of what
  they knew of contemporary kings.</p>

  <p>Now the Frisians were no insignificant tribe. They were a power,
  controlling the coasts of what was then called the "Frisian Sea<a
  name="NtA515" href="#Nt515"><sup>[515]</sup></a>." Commerce was in
  Frisian hands. Archaeological evidence points to a lively trade between
  the Frisian districts and the coast of Norway<a name="NtA516"
  href="#Nt516"><sup>[516]</sup></a>. From about the sixth century, when
  "Dorostates of the Frisians" is mentioned by the Geographer of Ravenna
  (or the source from which he drew) in a manner which shows it to have
  been known even in Italy as a place of peculiar <!-- Page 289 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page289"></a>{289}</span>importance<a
  name="NtA517" href="#Nt517"><sup>[517]</sup></a>, to the ninth century,
  when it was destroyed by repeated attacks of the Vikings, the Frisian
  port of Dorestad<a name="NtA518" href="#Nt518"><sup>[518]</sup></a> was
  one of the greatest trade centres of Northern Europe<a name="NtA519"
  href="#Nt519"><sup>[519]</sup></a>. By the year 700 the Frisian power had
  suffered severely from the constant blows dealt to it by the Frankish
  Mayors of the Palace. Yet evidence seems to show that even at that date
  the Frisian king ruled all the coast which intervened between the borders
  of the Franks on the one side and of the Danes on the other<a
  name="NtA520" href="#Nt520"><sup>[520]</sup></a>. When a zealous
  missionary demonstrated the powerlessness of the heathen gods by
  baptizing three converts in the sacred spring of Fosetisland, he was
  carried before the King of Frisia for judgement<a name="NtA521"
  href="#Nt521"><sup>[521]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>At a later date the "Danes" became the controlling power in the North
  Sea; but in the centuries before the Viking raids began, the Frisians
  appear to have had it all their own way.</p>

  <p>Finn, son of Folcwald, found his way into some English genealogies<a
  name="NtA522" href="#Nt522"><sup>[522]</sup></a> just as the Roman
  Emperor did into others. This also seems to point to the Frisian power
  having made an impression on the nations around.</p>

  <p>We should expect all this to be reflected in the story of the great
  Frisian king. How then would a seventh or eighth century Englishman
  regard Finn and his father Folcwalda? Probably as paramount chiefs,
  holding authority over the tribes of the South and East coast of the
  North Sea, similar to that which, for example, a Northumbrian king held
  over the tribes settled along the British coast. Indeed, the whole story
  of the Northumbrian kings, as given in Bede, deserves comparison: the
  relation with the subordinate tribes, the alliances, the feuds, the
  attempted assassinations, the loyalty of the thegns&mdash;this is the
  atmosphere amid which the Finn story grew up in England, and if we want
  to understand the story we must begin by getting this point of view.</p>

  <p>But, if this be a correct estimate of tribal conditions at the time
  the <i>Finnsburg</i> story took form, we no longer need far-fetched
  explanations to account for Finnsburg not being in Friesland. It is
  natural that it should not be, just as natural as that the contemporary
  Eadwinesburg should be outside the ancient limits of Deira. Nor do we
  need any far-fetched explanations why the Frisians should be called
  <i>Eotenas</i>. That the King of Frisia should have had Jutes under his
  rule is likely enough. And this is all that the words of the
  <i>Episode</i> demand.</p>

<h2>PART IV</h2>

<h3>APPENDIX</h3>

  <p><a name="appA"></a></p>

<p class="cenhead">A. A POSTSCRIPT ON MYTHOLOGY IN <i>BEOWULF</i></p>

<p class="cenhead">(1) <i>Beowulf the Scylding and Beowulf son of Ecgtheow</i></p>

  <p>It is now ten years since Prof. Lawrence attacked the mythological
  theories which, from the time when they were first enunciated by Kemble
  and elaborated by Müllenhoff, had wielded an authority over
  <i>Beowulf</i> scholars which was only very rarely disputed<a
  name="NtA523" href="#Nt523"><sup>[523]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Whilst in the main I agree with Prof. Lawrence, I believe that there
  <i>is</i> an element of truth in the theories of Kemble. It would,
  indeed, be both astonishing and humiliating if we found that a view,
  accepted for three-quarters of a century by almost every student, had no
  foundation. What is really remarkable is, not that Kemble should have
  carried his mythological theory too far, but that, with the limited
  information at his disposal, he at once saw certain aspects of the truth
  so clearly.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The mythological theories involve three propositions:</p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) That some, or all, of the supernatural stories told of
  Beowulf the Geat, son of Ecgtheow (especially the Grendel-struggle and
  the dragon-struggle), were originally told of Beowulf the Dane, son of
  Scyld, who can be identified with the Beow or Beaw<a name="NtA524"
  href="#Nt524"><sup>[524]</sup></a> of the genealogies.</p>

<p><!-- Page 292 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page292"></a>{292}</span></p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) That this Beow was an ancient "god of agriculture and
  fertility."</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) That therefore we can allegorize Grendel and the dragon
  into culture-myths connected with the "god Beow."</p>

  <p>Now (<i>c</i>) would not necessarily follow, even granting (<i>a</i>)
  and (<i>b</i>); for though a hero of story be an ancient god, many of his
  most popular adventures may be later accretion. However, these two
  propositions (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) would, together, establish a very
  strong probability that the Grendel-story and the dragon-story were
  ancient culture-myths, and would entitle to a sympathetic hearing those
  who had such an interpretation of them to offer.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>That Beow is an ancient "god of agriculture and fertility," I believe
  to be substantially true. We shall see that a great deal of evidence,
  unknown to Kemble and Müllenhoff, is now forthcoming to show that there
  <i>was</i> an ancient belief in a corn-spirit Beow: and this Beow, whom
  we find in the genealogies as son of Scyld or Sceldwa and descendant of
  Sceaf, is pretty obviously identical with Beowulf, son of Scyld Scefing,
  in the <i>Prologue</i> of <i>Beowulf</i>.</p>

  <p>So far as the <i>Prologue</i> is concerned, there is, then, almost
  certainly a remote mythological background. But before we can claim that
  this background extends to the supernatural adventures attributed to
  Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow, we must prove our proposition (<i>a</i>): that
  these adventures were once told, not of Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow, but of
  Beowulf or Beow, son of Scyld.</p>

  <p>When it was first suggested, at the very beginning of
  <i>Beowulf</i>-criticism, that Beowulf was identical with the Beow of the
  genealogies, it had not been realized that there were in the poem
  <i>two</i> persons named Beowulf: and thus an anonymous scholar in the
  <i>Monthly Review</i> of 1816<a name="NtA525"
  href="#Nt525"><sup>[525]</sup></a>, not knowing that Beowulf the slayer
  of Grendel is (at any rate in the poem as it stands) distinct from
  Beowulf, son of Scyld, connected both with Beow, son of Scyld, so
  initiating a theory which, for almost a century, was accepted as
  ascertained fact.</p>

<p><!-- Page 293 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page293"></a>{293}</span></p>

  <p>Kemble's identification was probably made independently of the work of
  this early scholar. Unlike him, Kemble, of course, realized that in our
  poem Beowulf the Dane, son of Scyld, is a person distinct from, is in
  fact not related to, Beowulf son of Ecgtheow. But he deliberately
  identified the two: he thought that two distinct traditions concerning
  the same hero had been amalgamated: in one of these traditions Beowulf
  may have been represented as son of Scyld, in the other as son of
  Ecgtheow, precisely as the hero Gunnar or Gunter is in one tradition son
  of Gifica (Giuki), in another son of Dankrat.</p>

  <p>Of course such duplication as Kemble assumed is conceivable. Kemble
  might have instanced the way in which one and the same hero reappears in
  the pages of Saxo Grammaticus, with somewhat different parentage or
  surroundings, as if he were a quite different person. The <i>Lives of the
  Two Offas</i> present another parallel: the adventures of the elder Offa
  have been transferred to the younger, so that, along with much that is
  historical or semi-historical, we have much in the <i>Life of Offa II</i>
  that is simply borrowed from the story of Offa I. In the same way it is
  conceivable that reminiscences of the mythical adventures of the elder
  Beowulf (Beow) might have been mingled with the history of the acts of
  the younger Beowulf, king of the Geatas. A guarantee of the intrinsic
  reasonableness of this theory lies in the fact that recently it has been
  put forward again by Dr Henry Bradley. But it is not enough that a theory
  should be conceivable, and be supported by great names. I cannot see that
  there is any positive evidence for it at all.</p>

  <p>The arguments produced by Kemble are not such as to carry conviction
  at the present day. The fact that Beowulf the Geat, son of Ecgtheow, "is
  represented throughout as a protecting and redeeming being" does not
  necessarily mean that we must look for some god or demigod of the old
  mythology&mdash;Frey or Sceaf or Beow&mdash;with whom we can identify
  him. This characteristic is strongly present in many Old English monarchs
  and magnates of historic, Christian, times: Oswald or Alfred or
  Byrhtnoth. Indeed, it might with much plausibility be argued that we are
  to see in this "protecting" character <!-- Page 294 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page294"></a>{294}</span>of the hero evidence of
  Christian rather than of heathen influence<a name="NtA526"
  href="#Nt526"><sup>[526]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Nor can we argue anything from the absence of any historic record of a
  king Beowulf of the Geatas; our records are too scanty to admit of
  argument from silence: and were such argument valid, it would only prove
  Beowulf fictitious, not mythological&mdash;no more necessarily an ancient
  god than Tom Jones or Mr Pickwick.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>There remains the argument of Dr Bradley. He points out that</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The poem is divided into numbered sections, the length of which was
  probably determined by the size of the pieces of parchment of which an
  earlier exemplar consisted. Now the first fifty-two lines, which are
  concerned with Scyld and his son Beowulf, stand outside this numbering.
  It may reasonably be inferred that there once existed a written text of
  the poem that did not include these lines. Their substance, however, is
  clearly ancient. Many difficulties will be obviated if we may suppose
  that this passage is the beginning of a different poem, the hero of which
  was not Beowulf the son of Ecgtheow, but his Danish namesake<a
  name="NtA527" href="#Nt527"><sup>[527]</sup></a>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In this Bradley sees support for the view that "there were circulated
  in England two rival poetic versions of the story of the encounters with
  supernatural beings: the one referring them to Beowulf the Dane" [of this
  the <i>Prologue</i> to our extant poem would be the only surviving
  portion, whilst] "the other (represented by the existing poem) attached
  them to the legend of the son of Ecgtheow."</p>

  <p>But surely many objections have to be met. Firstly, as Dr Bradley
  admits, the mention of Beowulf the Dane is not confined to the
  <i>Prologue</i>; this earlier Beowulf "is mentioned at the beginning of
  the first numbered section" and consequently Dr Bradley has to suppose
  that "the opening lines of this section have undergone alteration in
  order to bring them into connection with the prefixed matter." And why
  should we assume that the "passus" of <i>Beowulf</i> correspond to pieces
  of <!-- Page 295 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page295"></a>{295}</span>parchment of various sizes of which an
  earlier exemplar consisted? These "passus" vary in length from 43 lines
  to 142, a disproportion by no means extraordinary for the sections of one
  and the same poem, but very awkward for the pages of one and the same
  book, however roughly constructed. One of the "passus" is just twice the
  average length, and 30 lines longer than the one which comes next to it
  in size. Ought we to assume that an artificer would have made his book
  clumsy by putting in this one disproportionate page, when, by cutting it
  in two, he could have got two pages of just about the size he wanted?
  Besides, the different "passus" do not seem to me to show signs of having
  been caused by such mechanical reasons as the dimensions of the parchment
  upon which they were written. On the contrary, the 42 places where
  sections begin and end almost all come where a reader might reasonably be
  expected to pause: 16 at the beginning or end of a speech: 18 others at a
  point where the narrative is resumed after some digression or general
  remark. Only eight remain, and even with these, there is generally some
  pause in the narrative at the point indicated. In only two instances does
  a "passus" end at a flagrantly inappropriate spot; in one of these there
  is strong reason to suppose that the scribe may have caused the trouble
  by beginning with a capital where he had no business to have done so<a
  name="NtA528" href="#Nt528"><sup>[528]</sup></a>. Generally, there seems
  to be some principle governing the division of chapter from chapter, even
  though this be not made as a modern would have made it. But, if so, is
  there anything extraordinary in the first chapter, which deals with
  events three generations earlier than those of the body of the poem,
  being allowed to stand outside the numbering, as a kind of prologue?</p>

  <p>The idea of a preface or prologue was quite familiar in Old English
  times. The oldest <span class="scac">MSS</span><a name="NtA529"
  href="#Nt529"><sup>[529]</sup></a> of Bede's <i>History</i> have, at the
  end of the preface, <i>Explicit praefatio incipiunt capitula</i>. So we
  have in one of the two oldest <span class="scac">MSS</span><a
  name="NtA530" href="#Nt530"><sup>[530]</sup></a> of the <i>Pastoral
  Care</i> "Ðis is seo forespræc." On the other hand, the prologue or
  preface might be left without any heading or colophon, and the next <!--
  Page 296 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page296"></a>{296}</span>chapter begin as No. I. This is the case
  in the other <span class="scac">MS</span> of the <i>Pastoral Care</i><a
  name="NtA531" href="#Nt531"><sup>[531]</sup></a>. Is there, then, such
  difficulty in the dissertation on the glory of the ancient Danish kings
  being treated as what, in fact, it is: a prologue or preface; and being,
  as such, simply left outside the numbering?</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Still less can we argue for the identification of our hero, the son of
  Ecgtheow, with Frotho, and through him with Beow, from the supposed
  resemblances between the dragon fights of Beowulf and Frotho. Such
  resemblances have been divined by Sievers, but we have seen that it is
  the dissimilarity, not the resemblance, of the two dragon fights which is
  really noteworthy<a name="NtA532" href="#Nt532"><sup>[532]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>To prove that Beow was the original antagonist of Grendel there
  remains, then, only the mention in the charter of a <i>Grendles mere</i>
  near a <i>B&#x113;owan hamm</i><a name="NtA533"
  href="#Nt533"><sup>[533]</sup></a>. Now this was not known to Kemble at
  the time when he formed his theory that the original slayer of Grendel
  was not Beowulf, but Beow. And if the arguments upon which Kemble based
  his theory had been at all substantial, this charter would have afforded
  really valuable support. But the fact that two names occur near each
  other in a charter cannot confirm any theory, unless that theory has
  already a real basis of its own.</p>

<p class="cenhead">(2) <i>Beow</i></p>

  <p>Therefore, until some further evidence be discovered, we must regard
  the belief that the Grendel and the dragon stories were originally myths
  of Beow, as a theory for which sufficient evidence is not
  forthcoming.</p>

  <p>But note where the theory breaks down. It seems indisputable that
  Beowulf the Dane, son of Scyld Scefing, is identical with Beo(w) of the
  genealogies: for Beo(w) is son of Scyld<a name="NtA534"
  href="#Nt534"><sup>[534]</sup></a> or Sce(a)ldwa<a name="NtA535"
  href="#Nt535"><sup>[535]</sup></a>, who is a Scefing. But here we must
  stop. There is, as we have seen, no evidence that the Grendel or dragon
  adventures were transferred from him to their present hero, <!-- Page 297
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page297"></a>{297}</span>Beowulf the
  Geat, son of Ecgtheow. It would, of course, be quite possible to accept
  such transference, and <i>still</i> to reject the mythological
  interpretation of these adventures, just as it would be possible to
  believe that Gawain was originally a sun-hero, whilst rejecting the
  interpretation as a sun-myth of any particular adventure which could be
  proved to have been once told concerning Gawain. But I do not think we
  need even concede, as Boer<a name="NtA536"
  href="#Nt536"><sup>[536]</sup></a> and Chadwick<a name="NtA537"
  href="#Nt537"><sup>[537]</sup></a> do, that adventures have been
  transferred from Beowulf the Dane to Beowulf the Geat. We have seen that
  there is no evidence for such transference, however intrinsically likely
  it may be. Till evidence <i>is</i> forthcoming, it is useless to build
  upon Kemble's conjecture that Beowulf the Scylding sank into Beowulf the
  Wægmunding<a name="NtA538" href="#Nt538"><sup>[538]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>But it is due to Kemble to remember that, while he only put this
  forward as a tentative conjecture, what he <i>was</i> certain about was
  the identity of Beowulf the Scylding with Beow, and the divinity of these
  figures. And here all the evidence seems to justify him.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The divinity of the earlier Beówulf," Kemble wrote, "I hold for
  indisputable.... Beo or Beow is ... in all probability a god of
  agriculture and fertility.... It strengthens this view of the case that
  he is the grandson of Sceáf, <i>manipulus frumenti</i>, with whom he is
  perhaps in fact identical<a name="NtA539"
  href="#Nt539"><sup>[539]</sup></a>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Whether or no Beow and Sceaf were ever identical, it is certain that
  Beow (grain) the descendant of Sceaf (sheaf) suggests a corn-myth, some
  survival from the ancient worship of a corn-spirit.</p>

  <p>Now <i>b&#x113;ow</i>, 'grain, barley,' corresponds to Old Norse
  <i>bygg</i>, just as, corresponding to O.E. <i>tr&#x12B;ewe</i>, we have
  O.N. <i>tryggr</i>, or corresponding to O.E. <i>gl&#x113;aw</i>, O.N.
  <i>gl&#x1EB;ggr</i>. Corresponding to the O.E. proper name
  <i>B&#x113;ow</i>, we might expect an O.N. name, the first letters in
  which would be <i>Bygg(v)-</i>.</p>

  <p>And pat he comes, like the catastrophe of the Old Comedy. When Loki
  strode into the Hall of Ægir, and assailed with clamour and scandal the
  assembled gods and goddesses, there were present, among the major gods,
  also Byggvir and his wife <!-- Page 298 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page298"></a>{298}</span>Beyla, the servants of Frey, the god of
  agriculture and fertility. Loki reviles the gods, one after the other: at
  last he exchanges reproaches with Frey. To see his lord so taunted is
  more than Byggvir can endure, and he turns to Loki with the words:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Know thou, that were my race such as is that of Ingunar-Frey, and if I
  had so goodly a seat, finer than marrow would I grind thee, thou crow of
  ill-omen, and pound thee all to pieces<a name="NtA540"
  href="#Nt540"><sup>[540]</sup></a>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Byggvir is evidently no great hero: he draws his ideas from the
  grinding of the homely hand-mill, with which John Barleycorn has reason
  to be familiar:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">A miller used him worst of all,</p>
      <p>For he crushed him between two stones<a name="NtA541" href="#Nt541"><sup>[541]</sup></a>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Loki, who has addressed by name all the other gods, his acquaintances
  of old, professes not to know who is this insignificant being: but his
  reference to the hand-mill shows that in reality he knows quite well:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>What is that little creature that I see, fawning and sneaking and
  snuffling: ever wilt thou be at the ears of Frey, and chattering at the
  quern<a name="NtA542" href="#Nt542"><sup>[542]</sup></a>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Byggvir replies with a dignity which reminds us of the traditional
  characteristics of Sir John Barleycorn, or Allan O'Maut. For:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Uskie-bae ne'er bure the bell</p>
      <p>Sae bald as Allan bure himsel<a name="NtA543" href="#Nt543"><sup>[543]</sup></a>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 299 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page299"></a>{299}</span></p>

  <p>Byggvir adopts the same comic-heroic pose:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Byggvir am I named, and all gods and men call me hasty; proud am I, by
  reason that all the children of Odin are drinking ale together<a
  name="NtA544" href="#Nt544"><sup>[544]</sup></a>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But any claims Byggvir may make to be a hero are promptly dismissed by
  Loki:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Hold thou silence, Byggvir, for never canst thou share food justly
  among men: thou didst hide among the straw of the hall: they could not
  find thee, when men were fighting<a name="NtA545"
  href="#Nt545"><sup>[545]</sup></a>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now the taunts of Loki, though we must hope for the credit of Asgard
  that they are false, are never pointless. And such jibes as Loki
  addresses to Byggvir <i>would</i> be pointless, if applied to one whom we
  could think of as in any way like our Beowulf. Later, Beyla, wife of
  Byggvir, speaks, and is silenced with the words "Hold thy
  peace&mdash;wife thou art of Byggvir." Byggvir must have been a
  recognized figure of the old mythology<a name="NtA546"
  href="#Nt546"><sup>[546]</sup></a>, but one differing from the
  monster-slaying Beow of Müllenhoff's imagination.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Byggvir is a little creature (<i>et lítla</i>), and we have seen
  above<a name="NtA547" href="#Nt547"><sup>[547]</sup></a> that
  Scandinavian scholars have thought that they have discovered this old god
  in the Pekko who "promoted the growth of barley" among the Finns in the
  sixteenth century, and who is still worshipped among the Esthonians on
  the opposite side of the gulf as a three year old child; the form
  <i>Pekko</i> being derived, it is supposed, from the primitive Norse form
  *<i>Beggwuz</i>. This is a corner of a very big subject: the discovery,
  among the Lapps and Finns, of traces of the heathendom of the most <!--
  Page 300 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page300"></a>{300}</span>ancient Teutonic world, just as Thomsen
  has taught us to find in the Finnish language traces of Teutonic words in
  their most antique form.</p>

  <p>The Lappish field has proved the most successful hunting ground<a
  name="NtA548" href="#Nt548"><sup>[548]</sup></a>: among the Finns, apart
  from the Thunder-god, connection with Norse beliefs is arguable mainly
  for a group of gods of fruitfulness<a name="NtA549"
  href="#Nt549"><sup>[549]</sup></a>. The cult of these, it is suggested,
  comes from scattered Scandinavian settlers in Finland, among whom the
  Finns dwelt, and from whom they learnt the worship of the spirits of the
  seed and of the spring, just as they learnt more practical lessons. First
  and foremost among these stands Pekko, whom we know to have been
  especially the god of barley, and whose connection with Beow or Byggvir
  (*<i>Beggwuz</i>) is therefore a likely hypothesis enough<a name="NtA550"
  href="#Nt550"><sup>[550]</sup></a>. Much less certain is the connection
  of Sämpsä, the spirit of vegetation, with any Germanic prototype; he may
  have been a god of the rush-grass<a name="NtA551"
  href="#Nt551"><sup>[551]</sup></a> (Germ. <i>simse</i>). Runkoteivas or
  Rukotivo was certainly the god of rye, and the temptation to derive his
  name from Old Norse (<i>rugr-tivorr</i>, "rye-god") is great<a
  name="NtA552" href="#Nt552"><sup>[552]</sup></a>. But we have not
  evidence for <!-- Page 301 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page301"></a>{301}</span>the worship among Germanic peoples of such
  a rye-god, as we have in the case of the barley-god Byggvir-Beow. These
  shadowy heathen gods, however, do give each other a certain measure of
  mutual support.</p>

  <p>And, whether or no Pekko be the same as Byggvir, his worship is
  interesting as showing how the spirit of vegetation may be honoured among
  primitive folk. His worshippers, the Setukese, although nominally members
  of the Greek Orthodox Church, speak their own dialect and often hardly
  understand that of their Russian priests, but keep their old epic and
  lyric traditions more than almost any other section of the
  Finnish-Esthonian race. Pekko, who was honoured among the Finns in the
  sixteenth century for "promoting the growth of barley," survives among
  the present-day peasantry around Pskoff, not only as a spirit to be
  worshipped, but as an actual idol, fashioned out of wax in the form of a
  child, sometimes of a three year old child. He lives in the corn-bin, but
  on certain occasions is carried out into the fields. Not everyone can
  afford the amount of wax necessary for a Pekko&mdash;in fact there is
  usually only one in a village: he lodges in turn with different members
  of his circle of worshippers. He holds two moveable feasts, on moonlight
  nights&mdash;one in spring, the other in autumn. The wax figure is
  brought into a lighted room draped in a sheet, there is feasting, with
  dancing hand in hand, and singing round Pekko. Then they go out to decide
  who shall keep Pekko for the next year&mdash;his host is entitled to
  special blessing and protection. Pekko is carried out into the field,
  especially to preside over the sowing<a name="NtA553"
  href="#Nt553"><sup>[553]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>I doubt whether, in spite of the high authorities which support it, we
  can as yet feel at all certain about the identification of Beow and
  Pekko. But I think we can accept with fair certainty the identification
  of Beow and Byggvir. And we can at any rate use Pekko as a collateral
  example of the way in which a grain-spirit is regarded. Now in either
  case we find no support whatever for the supposition that the activities
  of <!-- Page 302 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page302"></a>{302}</span>Beow, the spirit of the barley, could, or
  would, have been typified under the guise of battles such as those which
  Beowulf the Geat wages against Grendel, Grendel's mother, and the dragon.
  In Beowulf the Geat we find much that suggests the hero of folk-tale,
  overlaid with much that belongs to him as the hero of an heroic poem, but
  nothing suggestive of a corn-myth. On the other hand, so long as we
  confine ourselves to Beow and his ancestor Sceaf, we <i>are</i> in touch
  with this type of myth, however remotely. The way that Sceaf comes over
  the sea, as recorded by William of Malmesbury, is characteristic. That
  "Sheaf" should be, in the language of Müllenhoff, "placed in a boat and
  committed to the winds and waves in the hope that he will return new-born
  in the spring" is exactly what we might expect, from the analogy of
  harvest customs and myths of the coming of spring.</p>

  <p>In Sætersdale, in Norway, when the ice broke up in the spring, and was
  driven ashore, the inhabitants used to welcome it by throwing their hats
  into the air, and shouting "Welcome, Corn-boat." It was a good omen if
  the "Corn-boats" were driven high and dry up on the land<a name="NtA554"
  href="#Nt554"><sup>[554]</sup></a>. The floating of the sheaf on a shield
  down the Thames at Abingdon<a name="NtA555"
  href="#Nt555"><sup>[555]</sup></a> reminds us of the Bulgarian custom, in
  accordance with which the venerated last sheaf of the harvest was floated
  down the river<a name="NtA556" href="#Nt556"><sup>[556]</sup></a>. But
  every neighbourhood is not provided with convenient rivers, and in many
  places the last sheaf is merely drenched with water. This is an essential
  part of the custom of "crying the neck."</p>

  <p>The precise ritual of "crying the neck" or "crying the mare" was
  confined to the west and south-west of England<a name="NtA557"
  href="#Nt557"><sup>[557]</sup></a>. But there is no such local limitation
  about the custom of drenching the <!-- Page 303 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page303"></a>{303}</span>last sheaf, or its
  bearers and escort, with water. This has been recorded, among other
  places, at Hitchin in Hertfordshire<a name="NtA558"
  href="#Nt558"><sup>[558]</sup></a>, in Cambridgeshire<a name="NtA559"
  href="#Nt559"><sup>[559]</sup></a>, Nottinghamshire<a name="NtA560"
  href="#Nt560"><sup>[560]</sup></a>, Pembrokeshire<a name="NtA561"
  href="#Nt561"><sup>[561]</sup></a>, Wigtownshire<a name="NtA562"
  href="#Nt562"><sup>[562]</sup></a> as well as in Holstein<a name="NtA563"
  href="#Nt563"><sup>[563]</sup></a>, Westphalia<a name="NtA564"
  href="#Nt564"><sup>[564]</sup></a>, Prussia<a name="NtA565"
  href="#Nt565"><sup>[565]</sup></a>, Galicia<a name="NtA566"
  href="#Nt566"><sup>[566]</sup></a>, Saxon Transsylvania<a name="NtA567"
  href="#Nt567"><sup>[567]</sup></a>, Roumania<a name="NtA568"
  href="#Nt568"><sup>[568]</sup></a> and perhaps in ancient Phrygia<a
  name="NtA569" href="#Nt569"><sup>[569]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Now it is true that drenching the last sheaf with water, as a rain
  charm, is by no means the same thing as floating it down the river, in
  the expectation that it will come again in the spring. But it shows the
  same sense of the continued existence of the corn-spirit. That the
  <i>seed</i>, when sown, should be sprinkled with water as a rain charm
  (as is done in places) seems obvious and natural enough. But when the
  <i>last sheaf</i> of the preceding harvest is thus sprinkled, to ensure
  plenteous rain upon the crops of next year, we detect the same idea of
  continuity which we find expressed when Sceaf comes to land from over the
  sea: the spirit embodied in the sheaf of last year's harvest returning,
  and bringing the renewed power of vegetation.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The voyage of the Abingdonian sheaf on the Thames was conducted upon a
  shield, and it may be that the "vessel without a rower" in which "Sheaf"
  came to land was, in the original version, a shield. There would be
  precedent for this. The shield was known by the puzzling name of "Ull's
  ship" in Scaldic poetry, presumably because the god Ull used his shield
  as a boat. Anyway, Scyld came to be closely connected with Sceaf and
  Beow. In Ethelwerd he is son of the former and father of the latter: but
  in the <i>Chronicle</i> genealogies five names intervene between Scyld
  and Sceaf, and the son of Sceaf is Bedwig, or as he is called in one
  version, Beowi. <i>Bedwig</i> and <i>Beowi</i> are probably derived from
  <i>Beowius</i>, the Latinized <!-- Page 304 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page304"></a>{304}</span>form of <i>Beow</i>. A badly formed
  <i>o</i> might easily be mistaken for a <i>d</i>, and indeed
  <i>Beowius</i> appears in forms much more corrupt. In that case it would
  appear that while some genealogies made Beow the son of Scyld, others
  made him son of Sceaf, and that the compiler of the pedigree got over the
  difficulty in the usual way, by adding the one version to the other<a
  name="NtA570" href="#Nt570"><sup>[570]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>But all this is very hypothetical; and how and when Scyld came to be
  connected with Sceaf and with Beow we cannot with any certainty say. At
  any rate we find no trace of such connection in Danish traditions of the
  primitive King Skjold of the Danes. But we can say, with some certainty,
  that in Beowulf the Dane, the son of Scyld Scefing, in our poem, we have
  a figure which is identical with Beow, son of Scyld or of Sceldwa and
  descendant of Sceaf, in the genealogies, and that this Beow is likely to
  have been an ancient corn-spirit, parallel to the Scandinavian Byggvir.
  That amount of mythology probably <i>does</i> underlie the
  <i>Prologue</i> to <i>Beowulf</i>, though the author would no doubt have
  been highly scandalized had he suspected that his pattern of a young
  prince was only a disguised heathen god. But I think that any further
  attempt to proceed, from this, to mythologize the deeds of Beowulf the
  Great, is pure conjecture, and probably quite fruitless conjecture.</p>

  <p>I ought not to conclude this note without reference to the admirable
  discussion of this subject by Prof. Björkman in <i>Englische
  Studien</i><a name="NtA571" href="#Nt571"><sup>[571]</sup></a>. This,
  with the elucidation of other proper names in <i>Beowulf</i>, was
  destined to be the last big contribution to knowledge made by that ripe
  and good scholar, whose premature loss we all deplore; and it shows to
  the full those qualities of wide knowledge and balanced judgment which we
  have all learnt to admire in him.</p>

  <p>The property described is near Watling Street, between Edgware,
  Hendon, and the River Brent. It is a low-lying <!-- Page 307 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page307"></a>{307}</span>district almost
  surrounded by the hills of Hampstead, Highgate, Barnet, Mill Hill,
  Elstree, Bushey Heath and Harrow. The bottom of the basin thus formed
  must have been a swamp<a name="NtA579"
  href="#Nt579"><sup>[579]</sup></a>. What the "gate" may have been it is
  difficult to say. A foreign scholar has suggested that it may have been a
  narrow mountain defile or possibly a cave<a name="NtA580"
  href="#Nt580"><sup>[580]</sup></a>: but this suggestion could never have
  been made by anyone who knew the country. The "gate" is likely to have
  been a channel connecting two meres&mdash;or it might have been a narrow
  piece of land between them&mdash;one of those <i>enge &#x101;npaðas</i>
  which Grendel and his mother had to tread. Anyway, there is nothing
  exceptional in this use of "gate" in connection with a water-spirit.
  Necker, on the Continent, also had his "gates." Thus there is a
  "Neckersgate Mill" near Brussels, and the name "Neckersgate" used also to
  be applied to a group of houses near by, surrounded by water<a
  name="NtA581" href="#Nt581"><sup>[581]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>All the other places clearly point to a water-spirit: two meres, two
  pits, a mire and a beck: for the most part situated in low-lying country
  which must in Anglo-Saxon times have been swampy. All this harmonizes
  excellently with the <i>fenfreoðo</i> of <i>Beowulf</i> (l. 851). Of
  course it does not in the least follow that these places were named after
  the Grendel of our poem. It may well be that there was in England a
  current belief in a creature Grendel, dwelling among the swamps. Von
  Sydow has compared the Yorkshire belief in Peg Powler, or the Lancashire
  Jenny Greenteeth. But these aquatic monsters are not exactly parallel;
  for they abide in the water, and are dangerous only to those who attempt
  to cross it, or at any rate venture too near the bank<a name="NtA582"
  href="#Nt582"><sup>[582]</sup></a>, whilst Grendel and even his mother
  are capable of excursions of some distance from their fastness amid the
  fens.</p>

<p><!-- Page 308 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page308"></a>{308}</span></p>

  <p>Of course the mere-haunting Grendel <i>may</i> have been identified
  only at a comparatively late date with the spirit who struggles with the
  hero in the house, and flees below the earth in the folk-tale.</p>

  <p>At any rate belief in a Grendel, haunting mere and fen, is clearly
  demonstrable for England&mdash;at any rate for the south and west of
  England: for of these place-names two belong to the London district, one
  to Wiltshire, one to Devonshire, two to Worcester and one to Stafford.
  The place-name <i>Grendele</i> in Yorkshire is too doubtful to be of much
  help. (<i>Domesday Book</i>, <span class="scac">I</span>, 302.) It is the
  modern village Grindale, four miles N.W. of Bridlington. From it,
  probably, is derived the surname <i>Grindle, Grindall</i> (Bardsley).</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Abroad, the nearest parallel is to be found in Transsylvania, where
  there is a <i>Grändels môr</i> among the Saxons of the Senndorf district,
  near Bistritz. The Saxons of Transsylvania are supposed to have emigrated
  from the neighbourhood of the lower Rhine and the Moselle, and there is a
  <i>Grindelbach</i> in Luxemburg which may possibly be connected with the
  marsh demon<a name="NtA583" href="#Nt583"><sup>[583]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Most of the German names in <i>Grindel-</i> or <i>Grendel-</i> are
  connected with <i>grendel</i>, "a bar," and therefore do not come into
  consideration here<a name="NtA584" href="#Nt584"><sup>[584]</sup></a>:
  but the Transsylvanian "Grendel's marsh<a name="NtA585"
  href="#Nt585"><sup>[585]</sup></a>," anyway, reminds us of the English
  "Grendel's marsh" or "mere" or "pit." Nevertheless, the local story with
  which the Transsylvanian swamp is connected&mdash;that of a peasant who
  was ploughing with six oxen and was swallowed up in the earth&mdash;is
  such that it requires considerable ingenuity to see any connection
  between it and the <i>Beowulf-Grendel</i>-tale<a name="NtA586"
  href="#Nt586"><sup>[586]</sup></a>.</p>

<p><!-- Page 309 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page309"></a>{309}</span></p>

  <p>The Anglo-Saxon place-names may throw some light upon the meaning and
  etymology of "Grendel<a name="NtA587"
  href="#Nt587"><sup>[587]</sup></a>." The name has generally been derived
  from <i>grindan</i>, "to grind"; either directly<a name="NtA588"
  href="#Nt588"><sup>[588]</sup></a>, because Grendel grinds the bones of
  those he devours, or indirectly, in the sense of "tormentor<a
  name="NtA589" href="#Nt589"><sup>[589]</sup></a>." Others would connect
  with O.N. <i>grindill</i>, "storm," and perhaps with M.E. <i>gryndel</i>,
  "angry<a name="NtA590" href="#Nt590"><sup>[590]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p>It has recently been proposed to connect the word with <i>grund</i>,
  "bottom": for Grendel lives in the <i>mere-grund</i> or <i>grund-wong</i>
  and his mother is the <i>grund-wyrgin</i>. Erik Rooth, who proposes this
  etymology, compares the Icelandic <i>grandi</i>, "a sandbank," and the
  common Low German dialect word <i>grand</i>, "coarse sand<a name="NtA591"
  href="#Nt591"><sup>[591]</sup></a>." This brings us back to the root "to
  grind," for <i>grand</i>, "sand" is simply the product of the grinding of
  the waves<a name="NtA592" href="#Nt592"><sup>[592]</sup></a>. Indeed the
  same explanation has been given of the word "ground<a name="NtA593"
  href="#Nt593"><sup>[593]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p>However this may be, the new etymology differs from the old in giving
  Grendel a name derived, not from his grinding or tormenting others, but
  from his dwelling at the bottom of the lake or marsh<a name="NtA594"
  href="#Nt594"><sup>[594]</sup></a>. The name would have a parallel in the
  Modern English <i>grindle</i>, <i>grundel</i>, German <i>grundel</i><a
  name="NtA595" href="#Nt595"><sup>[595]</sup></a>, a fish haunting the
  bottom of the water.</p>

  <p>The Old English place-names, associating Grendel as they do with meres
  and swamps, seem rather to support this.</p>

  <p>As to the Devonshire stream <i>Grendel</i> (now the Grindle or
  Greendale Brook), it has been suggested that this name is also <!-- Page
  310 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page310"></a>{310}</span>connected
  with the root <i>grand</i>, "gravel," "sand." But, so far as I have been
  able to observe, there is no particular suggestion of sand or gravel
  about this modest little brook. If we follow the River Clyst from the
  point where the Grindle flows into it, through two miles of marshy land,
  to the estuary of the Exe, we shall there find plenty. But it is clear
  from the charter of 963 that the name was then, as now, restricted to the
  small brook. I cannot tell why the stream should bear the name, or what,
  if any, is the connection with the monster Grendel. We can only note that
  the name is again found attached to water, and, near the junction with
  the Clyst, to marshy ground.</p>

  <p>Anyone who will hunt Grendel through the shires, first on the 6-in.
  ordnance map, and later on foot, will probably have to agree with the
  Three Jovial Huntsmen</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i10">This huntin' doesn't pay,</p>
      <p>But we'n powler't up an' down a bit, an' had a rattlin' day.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>But, if some conclusions, although scanty, can be drawn from
  place-names in which the word <i>grendel</i> occurs, nothing can be got
  from the numerous place-names which have been thought to contain the name
  <i>B&#x113;ow</i>. The clearest of these is the <i>on B&#x113;owan hammes
  hecgan</i>, which occurs in the Wiltshire charter of 931. But we can
  learn nothing definite from it: and although there are other instances of
  strong and weak forms alternating, we cannot even be quite certain that
  the Beowa here is identical with the Beow of the genealogies<a
  name="NtA596" href="#Nt596"><sup>[596]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The other cases, many of which occur in <i>Domesday Book</i> are
  worthless. Those which point to a weak form may often be derived from the
  weak noun <i>b&#x113;o</i>, "bee": "The Anglo-Saxons set great store by
  their bees, honey and wax being indispensables to them<a name="NtA597"
  href="#Nt597"><sup>[597]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p><i>B&#x113;as br&#x14D;c</i>, <i>B&#x113;as feld</i> (<i>Bewes
  feld</i>) occur in charters: but here a connection with
  <i>b&#x113;aw</i>, "horsefly," is possible: for parallels, one has only
  to consider the long list of places enumerated by Björkman, the names of
  which are derived from those of beasts, <!-- Page 311 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page311"></a>{311}</span>birds, or insects<a
  name="NtA598" href="#Nt598"><sup>[598]</sup></a>. And in such a word as
  <i>B&#x113;ol&#x113;ah</i>, even if the first element be
  <i>b&#x113;ow</i>, why may it not be the common noun "barley," and not
  the name of the hero at all?</p>

  <p>No argument can therefore be drawn from such a conjecture as that of
  Olrik, that <i>B&#x113;as br&#x14D;c</i> refers to the water into which
  the last sheaf (representing Beow) was thrown, in accordance with the
  harvest custom, and in the expectation of the return of the spirit in the
  coming spring<a name="NtA599" href="#Nt599"><sup>[599]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class="cenhead">C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON
GENEALOGY</p>

  <p>The problems to which this pedigree gives rise are very numerous, and
  some have been discussed above. There are four which seem to need further
  discussion.</p>

  <p>(I) A "Sceafa" occurs in <i>Widsith</i> as ruling over the Longobards.
  Of course we cannot be certain that this hero is identical with the Sceaf
  of the genealogy. Now there is no one in the long list of historic or
  semi-historic Longobard kings, ruling after the tribe had left
  Scandinavia, who bears a name at all similar. It seems therefore
  reasonable to suppose that Sceafa, if he is a genuine Longobard king at
  all, belongs to the primitive times when the Longobardi or Winnili dwelt
  in "Scadan," before the historic or semi-historic times with which our
  extant list deals. And Old English accounts, although making Sceaf an
  ancestor of the Saxon kings, are unanimous in connecting him with Scani
  or Scandza.</p>

  <p>Some scholars<a name="NtA600" href="#Nt600"><sup>[600]</sup></a> have
  seen a serious difficulty in the weak form "Sceafa," as compared with
  "Sceaf." But we have the exactly parallel cases of <i>Horsa</i><a
  name="NtA601" href="#Nt601"><sup>[601]</sup></a> compared with
  <i>Hors</i><a name="NtA602" href="#Nt602"><sup>[602]</sup></a>, and
  <i>Hr&#x1E3;dla</i><a name="NtA603" href="#Nt603"><sup>[603]</sup></a>
  compared with <i>Hr&#x1E3;del</i><a name="NtA604"
  href="#Nt604"><sup>[604]</sup></a>, <i>Hr&#x113;ðel</i>. Parallel, but
  not quite so certain, are <i>Sceldwa</i><a name="NtA605"
  href="#Nt605"><sup>[605]</sup></a> and <i>Scyld</i><a name="NtA606"
  href="#Nt606"><sup>[606]</sup></a>, <i>G&#x113;ata</i><a name="NtA607"
  href="#Nt607"><sup>[607]</sup></a> and <i>G&#x113;at</i><a name="NtA608"
  href="#Nt608"><sup>[608]</sup></a>, <i>B&#x113;owa</i><a name="NtA609"
  href="#Nt609"><sup>[609]</sup></a> and <i>B&#x113;aw, B&#x113;o(w)</i><a
  name="NtA610" href="#Nt610"><sup>[610]</sup></a>.</p>

<p><!-- Page 312 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page312"></a>{312}</span></p>

  <p>I do not think it has ever been doubted that the forms <i>Hors</i> and
  <i>Horsa</i>, or <i>Hr&#x113;ðel</i> and <i>Hr&#x1E3;dla</i>, relate to
  one and the same person. Prof. Chadwick seems to have little or no doubt
  as to the identity of <i>Scyld</i> and <i>Sceldwa</i><a name="NtA611"
  href="#Nt611"><sup>[611]</sup></a>, or <i>B&#x113;o</i> and
  <i>B&#x113;owa</i><a name="NtA612" href="#Nt612"><sup>[612]</sup></a>.
  Why then should the identity of <i>Sc&#x113;af</i> and
  <i>Sc&#x113;afa</i> be denied because one form is strong and the other
  weak<a name="NtA613" href="#Nt613"><sup>[613]</sup></a>? We cannot
  demonstrate the identity of the figure in the genealogies with the figure
  in <i>Widsith</i>; but little difficulty is occasioned by the weak
  form.</p>

  <p>(II) Secondly, the absence of the name <i>Sc&#x113;af</i> from the
  oldest <span class="scac">MS</span> of the <i>Chronicle</i> (the
  <i>Parker MS</i>, <i>C.C.C.C.</i> 173) has been made the ground for
  suggesting that when that <span class="scac">MS</span> was written
  (<i>c.</i> 892) Sceaf had not yet been invented (Möller,
  <i>Volksepos</i>, 43; Symons in <i>Pauls Grdr</i>. (2), <span
  class="scac">III</span>, 645; Napier, as quoted by Clarke,
  <i>Sidelights</i>, 125). But Sceaf, and the other names which are omitted
  from the <i>Parker MS</i>, are found in the other <span
  class="scac">MSS</span> of the <i>Chronicle</i> and the allied pedigrees,
  which are known to be derived independently from one and the same
  original. Now, unless the names were older than the <i>Parker MS</i>,
  they could not appear in so many independent transcripts. For, even
  though these transcripts are individually later, their <i>agreement</i>
  takes us back to a period earlier than that of the <i>Parker MS</i>
  itself<a name="NtA614" href="#Nt614"><sup>[614]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>An examination of the different versions of the genealogy, given on
  pp. <a href="#page202">202</a>-3, above, and of the tree showing the
  connection between them, on p. <a href="#page315">315</a>, will, I think,
  make this clear.</p>

  <p>The versions of the pedigree given in the <i>Parker MS</i> of the
  <i>Chronicle</i>, in Asser and in <i>Textus Roffensis I</i>, all contain
  the stages <i>Friþuwald</i> and <i>Friþuwulf</i>. Asser and <i>Roff.
  I</i> are connected by the note about <i>G&#x113;ata</i>: but <i>Roff.
  I</i> is not derived from that text of Asser which has come down to us,
  as that <!-- Page 313 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page313"></a>{313}</span>text has corrupted <i>Fin</i> and
  <i>Godwulf</i> into one name and has substituted <i>Seth</i> for
  <i>Sc&#x113;af</i> ["Seth, <i>Saxonice</i> Sceaf": Florence of
  Worcester]. <i>Roff. I</i> is free from both these corruptions.</p>

  <p>Ethelwerd is obviously connected with a type of genealogy giving the
  stages <i>Friþuwald</i> and <i>Friþuwulf</i>, but differs from all the
  others in giving no stages between <i>Scyld</i> and
  <i>Sc&#x113;f</i>.</p>

  <p>None of the other versions contain the names <i>Friþuwald</i> and
  <i>Friþuwulf</i>. They are closely parallel, but fall into groups showing
  special peculiarities.</p>

  <p><i>MSS Tib. A. VI</i> and <i>Tib. B. I</i> of the <i>Chronicle</i>
  show only trifling differences of spelling. The <span
  class="scac">MSS</span> belong respectively to about the years 1000 and
  1050, and are both derived from an Abingdon original of about 977<a
  name="NtA615" href="#Nt615"><sup>[615]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p><i>MS Cott. Tib. B. IV</i> is derived from a copy of the
  <i>Chronicle</i> sent North about 892<a name="NtA616"
  href="#Nt616"><sup>[616]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p><i>MS Cott. Tib. B. V</i> and <i>Textus Roffensis II</i> are closely
  connected, but neither is derived from the other. For <i>Roff. II</i>
  preserves <i>Teþwa</i> and <i>Hw&#x101;la</i>, who are lost in <i>Tib. B.
  V; Tib. B. V</i> preserves <i>Iterman</i>, who is corrupted in <i>Roff.
  II.</i> Both <i>Tib. B. V</i> and <i>Roff. II</i> carry the pedigree down
  to Edgar, mentioning his three sons <i>&#x112;adweard and &#x112;admund
  and Æþelred æðelingas syndon &#x112;adg&#x101;res suna cyninges</i>. The
  original therefore apparently belongs to some date before 970, when
  Edmund died (cf. Stevenson's Asser, 158, note).</p>

  <p>Common features of <i>MS Cott. Tib. B. V</i> and <i>Roff. II</i> are
  (1) <i>Eat(a)</i> for <i>Geat(a)</i>, (2) the omission of <i>d</i> from
  <i>Scealdwa</i>, and (3) the expression <i>se Sc&#x113;f</i>, "this
  Scef." Features (1) and (3) are copied in the Icelandic pedigrees.
  <i>Scealdwa</i> is given correctly there, but the Icelandic transcriber
  could easily have got it from <i>Scealdwaging</i> above. The Icelandic
  was, then, ultimately derived either from <i>Tib. B. V</i> or from a
  version so closely connected as not to be worth distinguishing.</p>

  <p>Accordingly <i>Cott. Tib. B. V</i>, <i>Textus Roffensis II</i>,
  <i>Langfeðgatal</i> and <i>Flateyarbók</i> form one group, pointing to an
  archetype <i>c.</i> 970.</p>

<p><!-- Page 314 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page314"></a>{314}</span></p>

  <p>The pedigrees can accordingly be grouped on the system shown on the
  opposite page<a name="NtA617" href="#Nt617"><sup>[617]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>(III) Prof. Chadwick, in his <i>Origin of the English Nation</i>,
  draws wide deductions from the fact that the Danes traced the pedigree of
  their kings back to Skjold, whilst the West-Saxons included Sceldwa
  (Scyld) in their royal pedigree:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Since the Angli and the Danes claimed descent from the same ancestor,
  there can be no doubt that the bond was believed to be one of blood<a
  name="NtA618" href="#Nt618"><sup>[618]</sup></a>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This belief, Prof. Chadwick thinks, went back to exceedingly early
  times<a name="NtA619" href="#Nt619"><sup>[619]</sup></a>, and he regards
  it as well-founded:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is true that the Angli of Britain seem never to have included
  themselves among the Danes, but the reason for this may be that the term
  <i>Dene</i> (<i>Danir</i>) had not come into use as a collective term
  before the invasion of Britain<a name="NtA620"
  href="#Nt620"><sup>[620]</sup></a>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Doubtless the fact that the name of a Danish king <i>Scyld</i> or
  <i>Sceldwa</i> is found in a pedigree of West-Saxon kings, as drawn up at
  a period certainly not later than 892, points to a belief, at that date,
  in some kind of a connection. But we have still to ask: How close was the
  connection supposed to be? And how old is the belief?</p>

  <p>Firstly as to the closeness of the connection. Finn also occurs in the
  pedigree&mdash;possibly the Frisian king: Sceaf occurs, possibly, though
  not certainly, a Longobard king. Noah and Adam occur; are we therefore to
  suppose that the compiler of the <i>Genealogy</i> believed his kings to
  be of one blood with the Hebrews? Certainly he did: but only remotely, as
  common descendants of Noah. And the occurrence of Sceldwa and Sceaf and
  Finn in the genealogies&mdash;granting the identity of these heroes with
  Skjold of the Danes, Sceafa of the Longobards and Finn of the Frisians,
  might only prove that the genealogist believed in their common (Germanic)
  race.</p>

  <p>Secondly, how old is the belief? The Anglian genealogies
  (Northumbrian, Mercian and East Anglian), as reproduced in the
  <i>Historia Brittonum</i> and in the <i>Vespasian MS</i>, form part of
  what is doubtless, as is said above, the oldest extant English historical
  document. But in this document <i>there is no mention of Scyld</i>.
  Indeed, it contains no pedigree of the West-Saxon kings at all. From
  whatever cause, the West-Saxon genealogy is not extant from so early a
  date as are the pedigrees of the Northumbrian, Mercian, East Anglian and
  Kentish kings<a name="NtA621" href="#Nt621"><sup>[621]</sup></a>. Still,
  this may well be a mere accident, and I am not prepared to dispute that
  the pedigree which traces the West-Saxon kings to Woden dates back, like
  the other genealogies connecting Old English kings with Woden, to
  primitive and heathen times. Now the West-Saxon pedigree is found in many
  forms: some which trace the royal house only to Woden, and some which go
  beyond Woden and contain a list of names by which Woden is connected with
  Sceaf, and then with Noah and Adam.</p>

  <p>(1) The nucleus of the whole pedigree is to be found in the names
  between Cynric or Cerdic and Woden. These occur in every version. The
  pedigree in this, its simplest form, is found twice among the entries in
  the <i>Chronicle</i> which deal with the events of heathen times, under
  552 and 597. These names fall into verse:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>[Cynr&#x12B;c Cerdicing], Cerdic Elesing,</p>
      <p>Elesa Esling, Esla GiWising,</p>
      <p>GiWis W&#x12B;ging, W&#x12B;g Fr&#x113;awining,</p>
      <p>Fr&#x113;awine Friðug&#x101;ring, Friðug&#x101;r Bronding,</p>
      <p>Brond B&#x1E3;ldæging, B&#x1E3;ldæg W&#x14D;dening.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Like the mnemonic lists in <i>Widsith</i>, these lines are probably
  very old. Their object is clearly to connect the founder of the
  West-Saxon royal house with Woden. Note, that not only do the names
  alliterate, but the alliteration is perfect. Every line attains double
  alliteration in the first half, with one alliterating word only in the
  second half. The lines must go back to times when lists of royal
  ancestors, both real and imaginary, had to <!-- Page 317 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page317"></a>{317}</span>be arranged in correct
  verse; times when such things were recorded by memory rather than by
  writing. They are pre-literary, and were doubtless chanted by retainers
  of the West-Saxon kings in heathen days.</p>

  <p>(2) An expanded form of this genealogy occurs in <i>MSS C.C.C.C.</i>
  183 and <i>Cotton Tib. B. V</i>. Woden is here furnished with a father
  Frealaf. We know nothing of any Frealaf as father of the All-Father in
  heathen days, though Frealaf is found in this capacity in other
  genealogies written down in the ages after the conversion. Frealaf breaks
  the correct alliterative system. In both <span class="scac">MSS</span>
  the pedigree is brought down to King Ine (688-726): both <span
  class="scac">MSS</span> are ultimately, no doubt, derived from a list
  current in the time of that king, that is to say less than a century
  after the conversion of Wessex.</p>

  <p>(3) A further expansion, which Prof. Napier has held on linguistic
  grounds<a name="NtA622" href="#Nt622"><sup>[622]</sup></a> to have been
  written down as early as 750, is incorporated in a genealogical and
  chronological note regarding the West-Saxon kings, which is extant in
  many <span class="scac">MSS</span><a name="NtA623"
  href="#Nt623"><sup>[623]</sup></a>. <i>In its present form</i> this
  genealogical note is a recension, under Alfred, of a document coming down
  to the death of his father Æthelwulf. It traces the pedigree of Æthelwulf
  to Cerdic, but it keeps this district from the rhythmical nucleus, in
  which it traces Cerdic to Woden, and no further.</p>

  <p>(4) Then, in the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>, under the year 855, the
  pedigree is given in its most elaborate form. There the genealogy of
  Æthelwulf is traced in one unbroken series, not merely through Cerdic to
  Woden, but from Woden through a long line of Woden's ancestors, including
  Frealaf, Geat, Sceldwa and Sceaf, to Noah and Adam.</p>

  <p>It has been noted above<a name="NtA624"
  href="#Nt624"><sup>[624]</sup></a> that none of the <i>Chronicle</i>
  pedigrees <!-- Page 318 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page318"></a>{318}</span>stop at Sceaf. The <i>Chronicle</i>, in
  the stages above Woden, recognizes as stopping places only Geat
  (Northumbrian pedigree, anno 547) or Adam (West-Saxon pedigree, anno
  855).</p>

  <p>(5) The Chronicle of Ethelwerd (<i>c.</i> 1000) does, however, stop at
  Scef<a name="NtA625" href="#Nt625"><sup>[625]</sup></a>. Now it has been
  argued that Ethelwerd's pedigree is merely abbreviated from the pedigree
  in the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> under 855, and that, in making Scef
  the final stage, and in what he tells us about that hero, Ethelwerd is
  merely adapting what he had read in <i>Beowulf</i> about Scyld<a
  name="NtA626" href="#Nt626"><sup>[626]</sup></a>. But this seems hardly
  possible. Ethelwerd, it is true, borrows most of his facts from the
  <i>Chronicle</i>, from Bede, and other known sources: but there are some
  passages which show that he had access to a source now lost. Ethelwerd
  was a member of the West-Saxon royal house, and he wrote his Chronicle
  for a kinswoman, Matilda, in order, as he says, to explain their common
  stock and race. They were both descended from Æthelwulf, the chronicler
  being great-great-grandson of Æthelred, and the lady to whom he dedicates
  his work being great-great-granddaughter of Alfred. So he writes to tell
  "who and whence were their kin, so far as memory adduces, and our parents
  have taught us." Accordingly, though he begins his Chronicle with the
  Creation, the bulk of it is devoted to the deeds of his or Matilda's
  ancestors. Is it credible that he would have cut out all the stages in
  their common pedigree between Scyld and Scef, that he would have
  sacrificed all the ancestors of Scef, thus severing relations with Noah
  and Adam, and that he would have attributed to Scef the story which in
  <i>Beowulf</i> is attributed to Scyld, all this simply in order to bring
  his English pedigree into some harmony with what is told about the Danish
  pedigree in <i>Beowulf</i>&mdash;a poem of which we have no evidence that
  he had ever heard?</p>

  <p>To suppose him to have done this, is to make him sacrifice, <i>without
  any reason</i>, just that part of the pedigree in the <i>Chronicle</i>
  under 855 which, from all we know of Ethelwerd, was most likely to have
  interested him: that which connected his race with Noah and Adam.
  Further, it is to suppose him to have reproduced just those stages in the
  pedigree which on critical <!-- Page 319 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page319"></a>{319}</span>grounds modern scholars can show to be the
  oldest, and to have modified or rejected just those which on critical
  grounds modern scholars can show to be later accretion. When Brandl
  supposes Ethelwerd to have produced his pedigree by comparing together
  merely the materials which have come down to us to-day, namely
  <i>Beowulf</i> and the <i>Chronicle</i>, he is, in reality, attributing
  to him the mind and acumen of a modern critic. An Anglo-Saxon alderman
  could only have detected and rejected the additions by using some
  material which has <i>not</i> come down to us. What more natural than
  that Ethelwerd, who writes as the historian of the West-Saxon royal
  family, should have known of a family pedigree which traced the line up
  to Sceaf and his arrival in the boat, and that he should have (rightly)
  thought this to be more authoritative than the pedigree in the
  <i>Chronicle</i> under the year 855, which had been expanded from it?
  Prof. Chadwick, it seems to me, is here quite justified in holding that
  Ethelwerd had "acquired the genealogy from some unknown source, in a more
  primitive form than that contained in the <i>Chronicle</i><a
  name="NtA627" href="#Nt627"><sup>[627]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p>But, because the source of Ethelwerd's pedigree is more primitive than
  that contained in the <i>Chronicle</i> under the year 855, it does not
  follow that it goes back to heathen times. Wessex had been converted more
  than two centuries earlier.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>We are now in a position to make some estimate of the antiquity of
  Scyld and Sceaf in the West-Saxon pedigree. The nucleus of this pedigree
  is to be found in the verses connecting Cynric and Cerdic with Woden.
  (Even as late as Æthelwulf and Alfred this nucleus is often kept distinct
  from the later, more historic stages connecting Cerdic with living men.)
  Pedigrees of other royal houses go to Woden, and many stop there;
  however, in times comparatively early, but yet Christian, we find Woden
  provided with five ancestors: later, Ethelwerd gives him ten: the
  <i>Chronicle</i> gives him twenty-five. It is evidently a process of
  accumulation.</p>

  <p>Now, if the name of Scyld had occurred in the portion of the pedigree
  which traces the West-Saxon kings up to Woden, <!-- Page 320 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page320"></a>{320}</span>it would possess
  sufficient authority to form the basis of an argument. But Scyld, like
  Heremod, Beaw and Sceaf, occurs in the fantastic development of the
  pedigree, by which Woden is connected up with Adam and Noah. The fact
  that these heroes occur <i>above</i> Woden makes it almost incredible
  that their position in the pedigree can go back to heathen times. Those
  who believed in Woden as a god can hardly have believed at the same time
  that he was a descendant of the Danish king Scyld. This difficulty Prof.
  Chadwick admits: "It is difficult to believe that in heathen times Woden
  was credited with five generations of ancestors, as in the
  <i>Frealaf-Geat</i> list." Still less is it credible that he was credited
  with 25 generations of ancestors, as in the
  <i>Frealaf-Geat-Sceldwa-Sceaf-Noe-Adam</i> list.</p>

  <p>The obvious conclusion seems to me to be that the names above Woden
  were added in Christian times to the original list, which in heathen
  times only went back to Woden, and <i>which is still extant in this
  form</i>. A Christian, rationalizing Woden as a human magician, would
  have no difficulty in placing him far down the ages, just as Saxo
  Grammaticus does<a name="NtA628" href="#Nt628"><sup>[628]</sup></a>.
  Obviously <i>Noe-Adam</i> must be an addition of Christian times, and the
  same seems to me to apply to all the other names above Woden, which,
  though ancient and Germanic, are not therefore ancient and Germanic in
  the capacity of ancestors of Woden.</p>

  <p>And even if these extraordinary ancestors of Woden were really
  believed in in heathen times, they cannot have been regarded as the
  special property of any one nation. For it was never claimed that the
  West-Saxon kings had any unique distinction in tracing their ancestry to
  Woden, such as would give them a special claim upon Woden's forefathers.
  How then can the ancient belief (if indeed it <i>were</i> an ancient
  belief) that Woden was descended from Scyld, King of Denmark, prove that
  the Anglo-Saxons regarded <i>themselves</i> as specially related to the
  Danes? For any such relationship derived through Woden must have been
  shared by all descendants of the All-Father.</p>

  <p>Prof. Chadwick avoids this difficulty by supposing that Woden did not
  originally occur in the pedigree, but is a later <!-- Page 321 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page321"></a>{321}</span>insertion<a
  name="NtA629" href="#Nt629"><sup>[629]</sup></a>. But how can this be so
  when, of the two forms in which the West-Saxon pedigree appears, one
  (and, so far as our evidence goes, much the older one) traces the kings
  to Woden <i>and stops there</i>. The <i>object</i> of this pedigree is to
  connect the West-Saxon kings with Woden. The expanded pedigrees, which
  carry on the line still further, from Woden to Sceldwa, Sceaf and Adam,
  though very numerous, are all traceable to one, or at most two, sources.
  It is surely not the right method to regard Woden as an interpolation
  (though he occurs in that portion of the pedigree which is common to all
  versions, some of which we can probably trace back to primitive times),
  and to regard as the original element Scyld and Sceaf (though they form
  part of the continuation of the pedigree found only in, at most, two
  families of <span class="scac">MSS</span> which we cannot trace back
  beyond the ninth century).</p>

  <p>Besides, there is the strongest external support for Woden in the very
  place which he occupies in the West-Saxon pedigree. That pedigree is
  traced in all its texts up to one Baldæg and his father Woden. Those
  texts which further give Woden's ancestry make him a descendant of
  Frealaf&mdash;they generally make Woden son of Frealaf, though some texts
  insert an intermediate Frithuwald.</p>

  <p>Now the very ancient Northumbrian pedigree also goes up, by a
  different route, to "Beldæg," and gives him Woden for a father. In some
  versions (e.g. the <i>Historia Brittonum</i>) the Northumbrian pedigree
  stops there: in others (e.g. the <i>Vespasian MS</i>) Woden has a father
  Frealaf. How then <i>can</i> it be argued, contrary to the unanimous
  evidence of all the dozen or more <span class="scac">MSS</span> of the
  West-Saxon pedigree, that <i>Woden</i>, standing as he does between his
  proper father and his proper son, is an interpolation? There is no
  evidence whatsoever to support such an argument, and everything to
  disprove it.</p>

  <p>The fact that Sceaf, Sceldwa and Beaw occur above Woden, that some
  versions of the pedigree stop at Woden, and that in heathen times
  presumably all must have stopped when they reached the All-Father, seems
  to me a fatal argument&mdash;not against the antiquity of the legends of
  Sceaf, Sceldwa, and <!-- Page 322 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page322"></a>{322}</span>Beaw, but against the antiquity of these
  characters in the capacity (given to them in the <i>Anglo-Saxon
  Chronicle</i>) of ancestors of the West-Saxon kings, and against the vast
  deduction concerning the origin of the English nation which Prof.
  Chadwick draws from this supposed antiquity.</p>

  <p>(IV) Precisely the same argument&mdash;that Sceaf, Sceldwa and Beaw
  are found <i>above Woden</i> in the pedigree of the English kings, and
  are not likely to have occupied that place in primitive heathen times, is
  fatal to the attempt to draw from this pedigree any argument that the
  myths of these heroes were specially and exclusively Anglo-Saxon. The
  argument of Müllenhoff and other scholars for an ancient, <i>purely
  Anglo-Saxon</i> Beowa-myth<a name="NtA630"
  href="#Nt630"><sup>[630]</sup></a> falls, therefore, to the ground.</p>

<p class="cenhead">D. EVIDENCE FOR THE DATE OF <i>BEOWULF</i>. THE
RELATION OF <i>BEOWULF</i> TO THE CLASSICAL EPIC</p>

  <p>A few years ago there was a tendency to exaggerate the value of
  grammatical forms in fixing the date of Old English poetry, and attempts
  were made to arrange Old English poems in a chronological series,
  according to the exact percentage of "early" to "late" forms in each.
  There has now been a natural reaction against the assumption that,
  granting certain forms to be archaic, these would necessarily be found in
  a percentage diminishing exactly according to the dates of composition of
  the various poems in which they occur. The reaction has now gone to the
  other extreme, and grammatical facts are in danger of being regarded as
  not being "in any way valid or helpful indications of dates<a
  name="NtA631" href="#Nt631"><sup>[631]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p>Schücking<a name="NtA632" href="#Nt632"><sup>[632]</sup></a>, in an
  elaborate recent monograph on the date of <i>Beowulf</i>, rejects the
  grammatical evidence as valueless, and proceeds to date the poem about
  two centuries later than has usually been held, placing its composition
  at the court of some christianized Scandinavian monarch in England, about
  900 <span class="scac">A.D.</span></p>

<p><!-- Page 323 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page323"></a>{323}</span></p>

  <p>But it surely does not follow that, because grammatical data have been
  misused, therefore no use can be made of them. And, if <i>Beowulf</i> was
  composed about the year 900, from stories current among the Viking
  settlers, how are we to account for the fact that the proper names in
  <i>Beowulf</i> are given, not in the Scandinavian forms of the Viking
  age, nor in corruptions of such forms, but in the correct English forms
  which we should expect, according to English sound laws, if the names had
  been brought over in the sixth century, and handed down traditionally<a
  name="NtA633" href="#Nt633"><sup>[633]</sup></a>?</p>

  <p>For example, King Hygelac no doubt called himself <i>Hugilaikaz</i>.
  The <i>Chochilaicus</i> of Gregory of Tours is a good&mdash;if
  uncouth&mdash;shot at reproducing this name. The name became, in Norse,
  <i>Hugleikr</i> and in Danish <i>Huglek</i> (<i>Hugletus</i> in Saxo):
  traditional kings so named are recorded, though it is difficult to find
  that they have anything in common with the King Hygelac in
  <i>Beowulf</i><a name="NtA634" href="#Nt634"><sup>[634]</sup></a>. Had
  the name been introduced into England in Viking times, we should expect
  the Scandinavian form, not <i>Hygel&#x101;c</i><a name="NtA635"
  href="#Nt635"><sup>[635]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Even in the rare cases where the character in <i>Beowulf</i> and his
  Scandinavian equivalent bear names which are not phonologically
  identical, the difference does not point to any corruption such as might
  have arisen from borrowing in Viking days<a name="NtA636"
  href="#Nt636"><sup>[636]</sup></a>. We have only to contrast the way in
  which the names of Viking chiefs are recorded in the <i>Anglo-Saxon
  Chronicle</i>, to be convinced that the Scandinavian stories recorded in
  <i>Beowulf</i> are due to contact during the age when Britain was being
  conquered, not during the Viking period three or four centuries later<a
  name="NtA637" href="#Nt637"><sup>[637]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>And the arguments from literary and political history, which Schücking
  adduces to prove his late date, seem to me to point in exactly the
  opposite direction, and to confirm the orthodox view which would place
  <i>Beowulf</i> nearer 700 than 900.</p>

<p><!-- Page 324 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page324"></a>{324}</span></p>

  <p>Schücking urges that, however highly we estimate the civilizing effect
  of Christianity, it was only in the second half of the seventh century
  that England was thoroughly permeated by the new faith. Can we expect
  already, at the beginning of the eighth century, a courtly work, showing,
  as does <i>Beowulf</i>, such wonderful examples of tact, modesty,
  unselfishness and magnanimity? And this at the time when King Ceolwulf
  was forced by his rebellious subjects to take the cowl. For Schücking<a
  name="NtA638" href="#Nt638"><sup>[638]</sup></a>, following Hodgkin<a
  name="NtA639" href="#Nt639"><sup>[639]</sup></a>, reminds us how, in the
  eighth century, out of 15 Northumbrian kings, five were dethroned, five
  murdered; two abdicated, and only three held the crown to their death;
  and how at the end of the century Charlemagne called the Northumbrian
  Angles "a perfidious and perverse nation, murderers of their lords."</p>

  <p>But surely, at the base of all this argument, lies the same assumption
  which, as Schücking rightly holds, vitiates so many of the grammatical
  arguments; the assumption that development must necessarily be in steady
  and progressive proportion. We may take Penda as a type of the
  unreclaimed heathen, and Edward the Confessor of the chaste and saintly
  churchman; but Anglo-Saxon history was by no means a development in
  steady progression, of diminishing percentages of ruffianism and
  increasing percentages of saintship.</p>

  <p>The knowledge of, and interest in, heathen custom shown in
  <i>Beowulf</i>, such as the vivid accounts of cremation, would lead us to
  place it as near heathen times as other data will allow. So much must be
  granted to the argument of Prof. Chadwick<a name="NtA640"
  href="#Nt640"><sup>[640]</sup></a>. But the Christian tone, so far from
  leading us to place <i>Beowulf</i> late, would <i>also</i> lead us to
  place it near the time of the conversion. For it is precisely in these
  times just after the conversion, that we get the most striking instances
  in all Old English history of that "tact, modesty, generosity, and
  magnanimity" which Schücking rightly regards as characteristic of
  <i>Beowulf</i>.</p>

  <p>King Oswin (who was slain in 651) was, Bede tells us, handsome,
  courteous of speech and bearing, bountiful both to great <!-- Page 325
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page325"></a>{325}</span>and lowly,
  beloved of all men for his qualities of mind and body, so that noblemen
  came from all over England to enter his service&mdash;yet of all his
  endowments gentleness and humility were the chief. We cannot read the
  description without being reminded of the words of the thegns in praise
  of the dead Beowulf. Indeed, I doubt if Beowulf would have carried
  gentleness to those around him quite so far as did Oswin. For Oswin had
  given to Bishop Aidan an exceptionally fine horse&mdash;and Aidan gave it
  to a beggar who asked alms. The king's mild suggestion that a horse of
  less value would have been good enough for the beggar, and that the
  bishop needed a good horse for his own use, drew from the saint the stern
  question "Is that son of a mare dearer to thee than the Son of God?" The
  king, who had come from hunting, stood warming himself at the fire,
  thinking over what had passed; then he suddenly ungirt his sword, gave it
  to his squire, and throwing himself at the feet of the bishop, promised
  never again to grudge anything he might give in his charities.</p>

  <p>Of course such conduct was exceptional in seventh century
  Northumbria&mdash;it convinced Aidan that the king was too good to live
  long, as indeed proved to be the case. But it shows that the ideals of
  courtesy and gentleness shown in <i>Beowulf</i> were by no means beyond
  the possibility of attainment&mdash;were indeed surpassed by a seventh
  century king. I do not know if they could be so easily paralleled in
  later Old English times.</p>

  <p>And what is true from the point of view of morals is true equally from
  that of art and learning. In spite of the misfortunes of Northumbrian
  kings in the eighth century, the <i>first third</i> of that century was
  "the Golden Age of Anglo-Saxon England<a name="NtA641"
  href="#Nt641"><sup>[641]</sup></a>." And not unnaturally, for it had been
  preceded by half a century during which Northumbria had been free both
  from internal strife and from invasion. The empire won by Oswiu over
  Picts and Scots in the North had been lost at the battle of Nectansmere:
  but that battle had been followed by the twenty years reign of the
  learned Aldfrid, whose scholarship did not prevent him from nobly
  retrieving the state of the kingdom<a name="NtA642"
  href="#Nt642"><sup>[642]</sup></a>, though he could not recover the lost
  dominions.</p>

<p><!-- Page 326 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page326"></a>{326}</span></p>

  <p>Now, whatever we may think of <i>Beowulf</i> as poetry, it is
  remarkable for its conscious and deliberate art, and for the tone of
  civilization which pervades it. And this half century was distinguished,
  above any other period of Old English history, precisely for its art and
  its civilization. Four and a half centuries later, when the works of
  great Norman master builders were rising everywhere in the land, the
  buildings which Bishop Wilfrid had put up during this first period of
  conversion were still objects of admiration, even for those who had seen
  the glories of the great Roman basilicas<a name="NtA643"
  href="#Nt643"><sup>[643]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Nor is there anything surprising in the fact that this "golden age"
  was not maintained. On the contrary, it is "in accordance with the
  phenomena of Saxon history in general, in which seasons of brilliant
  promise are succeeded by long eras of national eclipse. It is from this
  point of view quite in accordance with natural likelihood that the age of
  conversion was one of such stimulus to the artistic powers of the people
  that a level of effort and achievement was reached which subsequent
  generations were not able to maintain. The carved crosses and the coins
  certainly degenerate in artistic value as the centuries pass away, and
  the fine barbaric gold and encrusted work is early in date<a
  name="NtA644" href="#Nt644"><sup>[644]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p>Already in the early part of the eighth century signs of decay are to
  be observed. At the end of his <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>, Bede
  complains that the times are so full of disturbance that one knows not
  what to say, or what the end will be. And these fears were justified. A
  hundred and forty years of turmoil and decay follow, till the
  civilization of the North and the Midlands was overthrown by the Danes,
  and York became the uneasy seat of a heathen jarl.</p>

  <p>How it should be possible to see in these facts, as contrasted with
  the Christian and civilized tone of <i>Beowulf</i>, any argument for late
  date, I cannot see. On the contrary, because of its Christian
  civilization combined with its still vivid, if perhaps not always quite
  exact, recollection of heathen customs, we should be inclined to put
  <i>Beowulf</i> in the early Christian ages.</p>

<p><!-- Page 327 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page327"></a>{327}</span></p>

  <p>A further argument put forward for this late date is the old one that
  the Scandinavian sympathies of <i>Beowulf</i> show it to have been
  composed for a Scandinavian court, the court, Schücking thinks, of one of
  the princes who ruled over those portions of England which the Danes had
  settled<a name="NtA645" href="#Nt645"><sup>[645]</sup></a>. Of course
  Schücking is too sound a scholar to revive at this time of day the old
  fallacy that the Anglo-Saxons ought to have taken no interest in the
  deeds of any but Anglo-Saxon heroes. But how, he asks, are we to account
  for such <i>enthusiasm</i> for, such a burning interest in, a people of
  alien dialect and foreign dynasty, such as the Scyldings of Denmark?</p>

  <p>The answer seems to me to be that the enthusiasm of <i>Beowulf</i> is
  not for the Danish nation as such: on the contrary, <i>Beowulf</i>
  depicts a situation which is most humiliating to the Danes. For twelve
  years they have suffered the depredations of Grendel; Hrothgar and his
  kin have proved helpless: all the Danes have been unequal to the need.
  Twice at least this is emphasized in the most uncompromising, and indeed
  insulting, way<a name="NtA646" href="#Nt646"><sup>[646]</sup></a>. The
  poet's enthusiasm is not, then, for the Danish race as such, but for the
  ideal of a great court with its body of retainers. Such retainers are not
  necessarily native born&mdash;rather is it the mark of the great court
  that it draws men from far and wide to enter the service, whether
  permanently or temporarily, even as Beowulf came from afar to help the
  aged Hrothgar in his need.</p>

  <p>It is this ideal of personal valour and personal loyalty, rather than
  of tribal patriotism, which pervades <i>Beowulf</i>, and which certainly
  suits the known facts of the seventh and early eighth centuries. The
  bitterest strife in England in the seventh century had been between the
  two quite new states of Northumbria and Mercia, both equally of Anglian
  race. Both these states had been built up by a combination of smaller
  units, and not without violating the old local patriotisms of the diverse
  elements from which they had been formed. At first, at any rate, no such
  thing as Northumbrian or Mercian patriotism can have existed. Loyalty was
  personal, to the king. Neither the kingdom nor the <i>comitatus</i> was
  homogeneous. We have seen <!-- Page 328 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page328"></a>{328}</span>that Bede mentions it as a peculiar honour
  to a Northumbrian prince that <i>from all parts of England</i> nobles
  came to enter his service. We must not demand from the seventh or eighth
  century our ideals of exclusive enthusiasm for the land of one's birth,
  ideals which make it disreputable for a "mercenary" to sell his sword.
  The ideal is, on the contrary, loyalty to a prince whose service a
  warrior <i>voluntarily</i> enters. And the Danish court is depicted as a
  pattern of such loyalty&mdash;before the Scyldings began to work evil<a
  name="NtA647" href="#Nt647"><sup>[647]</sup></a>, by the treason of
  Hrothulf.</p>

  <p>Further, the fact that the Danish court at Leire had been a heathen
  one might be matter for regret, but it would not prevent its being
  praised by an Englishman about 700. For England was then entirely
  Christian. In the process of conversion no single Christian had, so far
  as we know, been martyred. There had been no war of religion. If Penda
  had fought against Oswald, it had been as the king of Mercia against the
  king of Northumbria. Penda's allies were Christian, and he showed no
  antipathy to the new faith<a name="NtA648"
  href="#Nt648"><sup>[648]</sup></a>. So that at this date there was no
  reason for men to feel any deep hostility towards a heathendom which had
  been the faith of their grandfathers, and with which there had never been
  any embittered conflict.</p>

  <p>But in 900 the position was quite different. For more than a
  generation the country had been engaged in a life-and-death struggle
  between two warring camps, the "Christian men" and the "heathen men." The
  "heathen men" were in process of conversion, but were liable to be ever
  recruited afresh from beyond the sea. It seems highly unlikely that
  <i>Beowulf</i> could have been written at this date, by some English
  poet, for the court of a converted Scandinavian prince, with a view
  perhaps, as Schücking suggests, to educating his children in the English
  speech. In such a case the one thing likely to be avoided by the English
  poet, with more than two centuries of Christianity behind him, would
  surely have been the praise of that Scandinavian heathendom, from which
  his patron had freed himself, and from which his children were to be
  weaned. The martyrdom of S. Edmund might have seemed a more appropriate
  theme<a name="NtA649" href="#Nt649"><sup>[649]</sup></a>. <!-- Page 329
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page329"></a>{329}</span>The tolerant
  attitude towards heathen customs, and the almost antiquarian interest in
  them, very justly, as it seems to me, emphasized by Schücking<a
  name="NtA650" href="#Nt650"><sup>[650]</sup></a>, is surely far more
  possible in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 700 than in <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 900. For between those dates heathendom had
  ceased to be an antiquarian curiosity, and had become an imminent
  peril.</p>

  <p>If those are right who hold that <i>Beowulf</i> is no purely native
  growth, but shows influence of the classical epic, then again it is
  easier to credit such influence about the year 700 than 900. At the
  earlier date we have scholars like Aldhelm and Bede, both well acquainted
  with Virgil, yet both interested in vernacular verse. It has been urged,
  as a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of the view which would connect
  <i>Beowulf</i> with Virgil, that the relation to the <i>Odyssey</i> is
  more obvious than that to the <i>Æneid</i>. Perhaps, however, some remote
  and indirect connection even between <i>Beowulf</i> and the
  <i>Odyssey</i> is not altogether unthinkable, about the year 700. At the
  end of the seventh century there was a flourishing school of Greek
  learning in England, under Hadrian and the Greek Archbishop Theodore,
  both "well read in sacred <i>and in secular</i> literature." In 730 their
  scholars were still alive, and, Bede tells us, could speak Greek and
  Latin as correctly as their native tongue. Bede himself knew something
  about the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i>. Not till eight centuries
  have passed, and we reach Grocyn and Linacre, was it again to be as easy
  for an Englishman to have a first-hand knowledge of a Greek classic as it
  was about the year 700. What scholarship had sunk to by the days of
  Alfred, we know: and we know that all Alfred's patronage did not produce
  any scholar whom we can think of as in the least degree comparable to
  Bede.</p>

  <p>So that from the point of view of its close touch with heathendom, its
  tolerance for heathen customs, its Christian magnanimity and gentleness,
  its conscious art, and its learned tone, all historic and artistic
  analogy would lead us to place <i>Beowulf</i> in the great age&mdash;the
  age of Bede.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>This has brought us to another question&mdash;more interesting to many
  than the mere question of date. Are we to suppose <!-- Page 330 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page330"></a>{330}</span>any direct connection
  between the classical and the Old English epic?</p>

  <p>As nations pass through their "Heroic Age," similar social conditions
  will necessarily be reflected by many similarities in their poetry. In
  heroic lays like <i>Finnsburg</i> or <i>Hildebrand</i> or the Norse
  poems, phrases and situations may occur which remind us of phrases and
  situations in the <i>Iliad</i>, without affording any ground for
  supposing classical influence direct or indirect.</p>

  <p>But there is much more in <i>Beowulf</i> than mere accidental
  coincidence of phrase or situation.</p>

  <p>A simple-minded romancer would have made the <i>Æneid</i> a biography
  of Æneas from the cradle to the grave. Not so Virgil. The story begins
  with mention of Carthage. Æneas then comes on the scene. At a banquet he
  tells to Dido his earlier adventures. Just so <i>Beowulf</i> begins, not
  with the birth of Beowulf and his boyhood, but with Heorot. Beowulf
  arrives. At the banquet, in reply to Unferth, he narrates his earlier
  adventures. The <i>Beowulf</i>-poet is not content merely to tell us that
  there was minstrelsy at the feast, but like Virgil or Homer, he must give
  an account of what was sung. The epic style leads often to almost verbal
  similarities. Jupiter consoling Hercules for the loss of the son of his
  host says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>stat sua cuique dies, breve et inreparabile tempus</p>
      <p>omnibus est vitae; sed famam extendere factis</p>
      <p>hoc virtutis opus<a name="NtA651" href="#Nt651"><sup>[651]</sup></a>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the same spirit and almost in the same words does Beowulf console
  Hrothgar for the loss of his friend:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>&#x16A;re &#x1E3;ghwylc sceal ende geb&#x12B;dan</p>
      <p>worolde l&#x12B;fes; wyrce s&#x113; þe m&#x14D;te</p>
      <p>d&#x14D;mes &#x1E3;r d&#x113;aþe; þæt biþ drihtguman</p>
      <p>unlifgendum æfter s&#x113;lest.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>On the other hand, though we are often struck by the likeness in
  spirit and in plan, it must be allowed that there is no tangible or
  conclusive proof of borrowing<a name="NtA652"
  href="#Nt652"><sup>[652]</sup></a>. But the influence may have been none
  the less effective for being indirect: nor is <!-- Page 331 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page331"></a>{331}</span>it quite certain that
  the author, had he known his Virgil, would necessarily have left traces
  of direct borrowing. For the deep Christian feeling, which has given to
  <i>Beowulf</i> its almost prudish propriety and its edifying tone, is
  manifested by no direct and dogmatic reference to Christian personages or
  doctrines.</p>

  <p>I sympathize with Prof. Chadwick's feeling that a man who knew Virgil
  would not have disguised his knowledge, and would probably have lacked
  both inclination and ability to compose such a poem as <i>Beowulf</i><a
  name="NtA653" href="#Nt653"><sup>[653]</sup></a>. But does not this
  feeling rest largely upon the analogy of other races and ages? Is it
  borne out by such known facts as we can gather about this period? The
  reticence of <i>Beowulf</i> with reference to Christianity does not
  harmonize with one's preconceived ideas; and Bishop Aldhelm gives us an
  even greater surprise. Let anyone read, or try to read, Aldhelm's
  <i>Epistola ad Acircium, sive liber de septenario et de metris</i>. Let
  him then ask himself "Is it possible that this learned pedant can also
  have been the author of English poems which King Alfred&mdash;surely no
  mean judge&mdash;thought best of all he knew?" These poems may of course
  have been educated and learned in tone. But we have the authority of King
  Alfred for the fact that Aldhelm used to perform at the cross roads as a
  common minstrel, and that he could hold his audiences with such success
  that they resorted to him again and again<a name="NtA654"
  href="#Nt654"><sup>[654]</sup></a>. Only after he had made himself
  popular by several performances did he attempt to weave edifying matter
  into his verse. And the popular, secular poetry of Aldhelm, his <i>carmen
  triviale</i>, remained current among the common people for centuries. Nor
  was Aldhelm's classical knowledge of late growth, something superimposed
  upon an earlier love of popular poetry, for he had <!-- Page 332 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page332"></a>{332}</span>studied under Hadrian
  as a boy<a name="NtA655" href="#Nt655"><sup>[655]</sup></a>. Later we are
  told that King Ine imported two Greek teachers from Athens for the help
  of Aldhelm and his school<a name="NtA656"
  href="#Nt656"><sup>[656]</sup></a>; this may be exaggeration.</p>

  <p>Everything seems to show that about 700 an atmosphere existed in
  England which might easily have led a scholarly Englishman, acquainted
  with the old lays, to have set to work to compose an epic. Even so
  venerable a person as Bede, during his last illness, uttered his last
  teaching not, as we should expect on <i>a priori</i> grounds, in Latin
  hexameters, but in English metre. The evidence for this is conclusive<a
  name="NtA657" href="#Nt657"><sup>[657]</sup></a>. But, at a later date,
  Alcuin would surely have condemned the minstrelsy of Aldhelm<a
  name="NtA658" href="#Nt658"><sup>[658]</sup></a>. Even King Alfred seems
  to have felt that it needed some apology. It would have rendered Aldhelm
  liable to severe censure under the Laws of King Edgar<a name="NtA659"
  href="#Nt659"><sup>[659]</sup></a>; and Dunstan's biographer indignantly
  denies the charge brought against his hero of having learnt the heathen
  songs of his forefathers<a name="NtA660"
  href="#Nt660"><sup>[660]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The evidence is not as plentiful as we might wish, but it rather
  suggests that the chasm between secular poetry and ecclesiastical
  learning was more easily bridged in the first generations after the
  conversion than was the case later.</p>

  <p>But, however that may be, it assuredly does not give any grounds for
  abandoning the old view, based largely upon grammatical and metrical
  considerations, which would make <i>Beowulf</i> a product of the early
  eighth century, and substituting for it a theory which would make our
  poem a product of mixed Saxon and Danish society in the early tenth
  century.</p>

<p class="cenhead">E. THE "JUTE-QUESTION" REOPENED</p>

  <p>The view that the Geatas of <i>Beowulf</i> are the Jutes (Iuti, Iutae)
  of Bede (i.e. the tribe which colonized Kent, the Isle of Wight and
  Hampshire) has been held by many eminent scholars. It was dealt with only
  briefly above (pp. 8-9) because I thought the theory was now recognized
  as being no longer tenable. Lately, however, it has been maintained with
  conviction and ability by two Danish scholars, Schütte and Kier. It
  therefore becomes necessary once more to reopen the question, now that
  the only elaborate discussion of it in the English language favours the
  "Jute-theory," especially as Axel Olrik gave the support of his great
  name to the view that "the question is still open<a name="NtA661"
  href="#Nt661"><sup>[661]</sup></a>" and that "the last word has not been
  said concerning the nationality of the Geatas<a name="NtA662"
  href="#Nt662"><sup>[662]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p>As in most controversies, a number of rather irrelevant side issues
  have been introduced<a name="NtA663" href="#Nt663"><sup>[663]</sup></a>,
  so that from mere weariness students are sometimes inclined to leave the
  problem undecided. Yet the interpretation of the opening chapters of
  Scandinavian history turns upon it.</p>

  <p>Supporters of the "Jute-theory" have seldom approached the subject
  from the point of view of Old English. Bugge<a name="NtA664"
  href="#Nt664"><sup>[664]</sup></a> perhaps did so: but the "Jute-theory"
  has been held chiefly by students of Scandinavian history, literature or
  geography, like Fahlbeck<a name="NtA665"
  href="#Nt665"><sup>[665]</sup></a>, Steenstrup<a name="NtA666"
  href="#Nt666"><sup>[666]</sup></a>, Gering<a name="NtA667"
  href="#Nt667"><sup>[667]</sup></a>, Olrik<a name="NtA668"
  href="#Nt668"><sup>[668]</sup></a>, Schütte<a name="NtA669"
  href="#Nt669"><sup>[669]</sup></a> and Kier<a name="NtA670"
  href="#Nt670"><sup>[670]</sup></a>. But, now that the laws of Old English
  sound-change have been <!-- Page 334 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page334"></a>{334}</span>clearly defined, it seldom happens that
  anyone who approaches the subject primarily as a student of the
  Anglo-Saxon language holds the view that the Geatas are Jutes.</p>

  <p>And this is naturally so: for, from the point of view of language, the
  question is not disputable. The <i>G&#x113;atas</i> phonologically are
  the <i>Gautar</i> (the modern Götar of Southern Sweden). It is admitted
  that the words are identical<a name="NtA671"
  href="#Nt671"><sup>[671]</sup></a>. And, equally, it is admitted that the
  word <i>G&#x113;atas</i> cannot be identical with the word <i>Iuti</i>,
  <i>Iutae</i>, used by Bede as the name of the Jutes who colonized Kent<a
  href="#Nt671"><sup>[671]</sup></a>. Bede's <i>Iuti</i>, <i>Iutae</i>, on
  the contrary, would correspond to a presumed Old English
  <i>*&#x12A;uti</i> or <i>*&#x12A;utan</i><a name="NtA672"
  href="#Nt672"><sup>[672]</sup></a>, current in his time in Northumbria.
  This in later Northumbrian would become <i>&#x12A;ote</i>,
  <i>&#x12A;otan</i> (though the form <i>&#x12A;ute</i>, <i>&#x12A;utan</i>
  might also survive). The dialect forms which we should expect (and which
  we find in the genitive and dative) corresponding to this would be:
  Mercian, <i>&#x112;ote</i>, <i>&#x112;otan</i>; Late West-Saxon,
  <i>&#x232;te</i>, <i>&#x232;tan</i> (through an intermediate Early
  West-Saxon <i>*&#x12A;ete</i>, <i>*&#x12A;etan</i>, which is not
  recorded).</p>

  <p>If, then, the word <i>G&#x113;atas</i> came to supplant the correct
  form <i>&#x12A;ote</i>, <i>&#x12A;otan</i> (or its Mercian and West-Saxon
  equivalents <i>&#x112;ote</i>, <i>&#x112;otan</i>, <i>&#x232;te</i>,
  <i>&#x232;tan</i>), this can only have been the result of confusion. Such
  confusion is, on abstract grounds, conceivable: it is always possible
  that the name of one tribe may come to be attached to another. "Scot" has
  ceased to mean "Irishman," and has come to mean "North Briton"; and there
  is no intrinsic impossibility in the word <i>G&#x113;atas</i> having been
  transferred by Englishmen, from the half-forgotten Gautar, to the Jutes,
  and having driven out the correct name of the latter, <i>&#x12A;ote</i>,
  <i>&#x12A;otan</i>. For example, there might have been an exiled Geatic
  family among the Jutish invaders, which might have become so prominent as
  to cause <!-- Page 335 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page335"></a>{335}</span>the name <i>G&#x113;atas</i> to supplant
  the correct <i>&#x12A;ote</i>, <i>&#x112;ote</i>, etc. But, whoever the
  Geatas may have been, <i>Beowulf</i> is their chief early record: indeed,
  almost all we know of their earliest history is derived from
  <i>Beowulf</i>. In <i>Beowulf</i>, therefore, if anywhere, the old names
  and traditions should be remembered. The word <i>G&#x113;at</i> occurs
  some 50 times in the poem. The poet obviously wishes to use other
  synonyms, for the sake of variety and alliteration: hence we get
  <i>Weder-G&#x113;atas</i>, <i>Wederas</i>, <i>S&#x1E3;-G&#x113;atas</i>,
  <i>G&#x16B;ð-G&#x113;atas</i>. Now, if these Geatas are the Jutes, how
  comes it that the poet <i>never</i> calls them such, never speaks of them
  under the correct tribal name of <i>&#x112;ote</i>, etc., although this
  was the current name at the time <i>Beowulf</i> was written, and indeed
  for centuries later?</p>

  <p>For, demonstrably, the form <i>&#x112;ote</i>, etc., <i>was</i>
  recognized as the name of the Jutes till at least the twelfth century.
  Then it died out of current speech, and only Bede's Latin <i>Iuti</i>
  (and the modern "Jute" derived therefrom) remained as terms used by the
  historians. The evidence is conclusive:</p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) Bede, writing about the time when <i>Beowulf</i>, in its
  present form, is supposed to have been composed, uses <i>Iuti</i>,
  <i>Iutae</i>, corresponding to a presumed contemporary Northumbrian
  <i>*&#x12A;uti</i>, <i>*&#x12A;utan</i>.</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) In the O.E. translation of Bede, made in Mercia perhaps two
  centuries after Bede's time, we do indeed in one place find "Geata,"
  "Geatum" used to translate "Iutarum," "Iutis," instead of the correctly
  corresponding Mercian form "Eota," "Eotum." Only two <span
  class="scac">MSS</span> are extant at this point. But since both agree,
  and since they belong to different types, it is probable that "Geata"
  here is no mere copyist's error, but is due to the translator himself<a
  name="NtA673" href="#Nt673"><sup>[673]</sup></a>. But, later, when the
  translator <!-- Page 336 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page336"></a>{336}</span>has to render Bede's "Iutorum," he gives,
  not "Geata," but the correct Mercian "Eota." There can be no possible
  doubt here, for five <span class="scac">MSS</span> are extant at this
  point, and all give the correct form&mdash;four in the Mercian, "Eota,"
  whilst one gives the West-Saxon equivalent, "Ytena."</p>

  <p>Now the <i>G&#x113;ata</i>-passage in the Bede translation is the
  chief piece of evidence which those who would explain the Geatas of
  <i>Beowulf</i> as "Jutes" can call: and it does not, in fact, much help
  them. What they have to prove is that the <i>Beowulf</i>-poet could
  <i>consistently and invariably</i> have used <i>G&#x113;atas</i> in the
  place of <i>&#x112;ote</i>. To produce an instance in which the two terms
  are both used by the same translator is very little use, when what has to
  be proved is that the one term had already, at a much earlier period,
  entirely ousted the other.</p>

  <p>All our other evidence is for the invariable use of the correct form
  <i>&#x12A;ote</i>, <i>&#x12A;otan</i>, etc. in Old English.</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) The passage from Bede was again translated, and inserted
  into a copy of the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>, which was sent quite
  early to one of the great abbeys of Northumbria<a name="NtA674"
  href="#Nt674"><sup>[674]</sup></a>. In this, "Iutis, Iutarum" is
  represented by the correct Northumbrian equivalent, "Iutum," "Iotum";
  "Iutna."</p>

  <p>(<i>d</i>) This Northumbrian Chronicle, or a transcript of it,
  subsequently came South, to Canterbury. There, roughly about the year
  1100, it was used to interpolate an Early West-Saxon copy of the
  Chronicle. Surely at Canterbury, the capital of the old Jutish kingdom,
  people must have known the correct form of the Jutish name, whether
  <i>G&#x113;atas</i> or <i>&#x12A;ote</i>. We find the forms "Iotum,"
  "Iutum"; "Iutna."</p>

  <p>(<i>e</i>) Corresponding to this Northumbrian (and Kentish) form
  <i>&#x12A;ote</i>, Mercian <i>&#x112;ote</i>, the Late West-Saxon form
  should be <i>&#x232;te</i>. Now <i>MS Corpus Christi College,
  Cambridge</i>, 41, gives us "the Wessex version of the English Bede" and
  is written by a scribe who knew the Hampshire district<a name="NtA675"
  href="#Nt675"><sup>[675]</sup></a>. In this <span class="scac">MS</span>
  the "Eota" of the Mercian original has been transcribed as "Ytena,"
  "Eotum" as "Ytum," showing that the scribe understood the tribal name and
  its equivalent correctly. This was about the <!-- Page 337 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page337"></a>{337}</span>time of the Norman
  Conquest, but the name continued to be understood till the early twelfth
  century at least. For Florence of Worcester records that William Rufus
  was slain <i>in Noua Foresta quae lingua Anglorum Ytene nuncupatur</i>;
  and in another place he speaks of the same event as happening <i>in
  prouincia Jutarum in Noua Foresta</i><a name="NtA676"
  href="#Nt676"><sup>[676]</sup></a>, which shows that Florence understood
  that "Ytene" was <i>&#x232;tena land</i>, "the province of the
  Jutes."</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>It comes, then, to this. The "Jute-hypothesis" postulates not only
  that, at the time <i>Beowulf</i> was composed, <i>G&#x113;atas</i> had
  come to mean "Jutes," but also that it had so completely ousted the
  correct old name <i>&#x12A;uti, &#x12A;ote, &#x112;ote, &#x232;te</i>,
  that none of the latter terms are ever used in the poem as synonyms for
  Beowulf's people<a name="NtA677" href="#Nt677"><sup>[677]</sup></a>. Yet
  all the evidence shows that <i>&#x12A;uti</i> etc. was the recognized
  name when Bede wrote, and we have evidence at intervals showing that it
  was so understood till four centuries later. But not only was
  <i>&#x12A;uti</i>, <i>&#x12A;ote</i> never superseded in O.E. times;
  there is no real evidence that <i>G&#x113;atas</i> was ever
  <i>generally</i> used to signify "Jutes." The fact that one translator in
  one passage (writing probably some two centuries after <i>Beowulf</i> was
  composed) uses "Geata," "Geatum," where he should have used "Eota,"
  "Eotum," does not prove the misnomer to have been
  general&mdash;especially when the same translator subsequently uses the
  correct form "Eota."</p>

  <p>I do not think sufficient importance has been attached to what seems
  (to me) the vital argument against the "Jute-theory." It is not merely
  that <i>G&#x113;atas</i> is the exact phonological equivalent of
  <i>Gautar</i> (Götar) and cannot be equivalent to Bede's <i>Iuti</i>.
  This difficulty may be got over by the assumption that somehow the
  <i>Iuti</i>, or some of them, had adopted the name <i>G&#x113;atas</i>:
  and we are not in a position to disprove such assumption. But the
  advocates of the "Jute-theory" have further to assume that, at the date
  when <i>Beowulf</i> was written, the correct name <i>Iuti</i>
  (Northumbrian <i>&#x12A;ote</i>, Mercian <i>&#x112;ote</i>, West-Saxon
  <i>&#x232;te</i>) must have so passed into disuse that it could not be
  once used as a <!-- Page 338 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page338"></a>{338}</span>synonym for Beowulf's people, by our
  synonym-hunting poet. And this assumption we <i>are</i> in a position to
  disprove.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The Jute-theory would therefore still be untenable on the ground of
  the name, even though it were laboriously proved that, from the
  historical and geographical standpoint, there was more to be said for it
  than had hitherto been recognized. But even this has not been proved:
  quite the reverse. As I have tried to show above, historical and
  geographical considerations, though in themselves not absolutely
  conclusive, point emphatically to an identification with the Götar,
  rather than with the Jutes<a name="NtA678"
  href="#Nt678"><sup>[678]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The relations of Beowulf and the Geatas with the kings of Denmark and
  of Sweden are the constant topic of the poem. Now the land of the Götar
  <i>was</i> situated between Denmark and Sweden. But if the Geatas be
  Jutes, their neighbours were the Danes on the east and the Angles on the
  south; farther away, across the Cattegat lay the Götar, and beyond these
  the Swedes. If the Geatas be Jutes, why should their immediate
  neighbours, the Angles, never appear in <i>Beowulf</i> as having any
  dealings with them? And why, above all, should the Götar never be
  mentioned, whilst the Swedes, far to the north, play so large a part?
  Even if Swedes and Götar had at this time been under one king, the Götar
  could not have been thus ignored, seeing that, owing to their position,
  the brunt of the fighting must have fallen on them<a name="NtA679"
  href="#Nt679"><sup>[679]</sup></a>. But we know that the Götar were
  independent. The strictly contemporary evidence of Procopius shows quite
  conclusively that they were one of the strongest of the Scandinavian
  kingdoms<a name="NtA680" href="#Nt680"><sup>[680]</sup></a>. How then
  could warfare be carried on for three generations between Jutes and
  Swedes without concerning the Götar, whose territory lay in between?</p>

  <p>Again, in the "Catalogue of Kings" in <i>Widsith</i>, the Swedes are
  named with their famous king Ongentheow. The Jutes (<i>&#x232;te</i>) are
  also mentioned, with <i>their</i> king. And their king is <!-- Page 339
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page339"></a>{339}</span>not Hrethel,
  Hæthcyn, Hygelac or Heardred, but a certain Gefwulf, whose name does not
  even alliterate with that of any known king of the Geatas<a name="NtA681"
  href="#Nt681"><sup>[681]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Again, in the (certainly very early) <i>Book on Monsters</i>, Hygelac
  is described as <i>Huiglaucus qui imperavit Getis</i>. Now Getis can mean
  Götar<a name="NtA682" href="#Nt682"><sup>[682]</sup></a>, but can hardly
  mean Jutes.</p>

  <p>The geographical case against the identification of Geatas and Götar
  depends upon the assumption that the western sea-coast of the Götar in
  ancient times must have coincided with that of West Gothland
  (Vestra-Götland) in mediæval and modern times. Now as this coast consists
  merely of a small strip south of the river Götaelv, it is argued that the
  Götar could not be the maritime Geatas of <i>Beowulf</i>, capable of
  undertaking a Viking raid to the mouth of the Rhine. But the assumption
  that the frontiers of the Götar about <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 500
  were the same as they were a thousand years later, is not only improbable
  on <i>a priori</i> grounds, but, as Schück has shown<a name="NtA683"
  href="#Nt683"><sup>[683]</sup></a>, can be definitely disproved. Adam of
  Bremen, writing in the eleventh century, speaks of the river Gothelba
  (Götaelv) as running through the midst of the peoples of the Götar. And
  the obvious connection between the name of the river and the name of the
  people seems to make it certain that Adam is right, and that the original
  Götar must have dwelt around the river Götaelv. But, if so, then they
  were a maritime folk: for the river Götaelv is merely the outlet which
  connects Lake Wener with the sea, running a course almost parallel with
  the shore and nowhere very distant from it<a name="NtA684"
  href="#Nt684"><sup>[684]</sup></a>. But even when Adam wrote, the <!--
  Page 340 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page340"></a>{340}</span>Götar
  to the north of the river had long been politically subject to Norway<a
  name="NtA685" href="#Nt685"><sup>[685]</sup></a>: and the
  <i>Heimskringla</i> tells us how this happened.</p>

  <p>Harold Fairhair, King of Norway (a contemporary of King Alfred),
  attacked them: they had staked the river Götaelv against him, but he
  moored his ships to the stakes<a name="NtA686"
  href="#Nt686"><sup>[686]</sup></a> and harried <i>on either shore</i>: he
  fought far and wide in the country, had many battles <i>on either side of
  the river</i>, and finally slew the leader of the Götar, Hrani Gauzki
  (the Götlander). Then he annexed to Norway all the land north of the
  river and west of Lake Wener. Thenceforward the Götaelv was the boundary
  between Norway and West Gothland, though the country ultimately became
  Swedish, as it now is. But it is abundantly clear from the
  <i>Heimskringla</i> that Harold regarded as hostile all the territory
  north of the Götaelv, and between Lake Wener and the sea<a name="NtA687"
  href="#Nt687"><sup>[687]</sup></a> (the old Ránriki and the modern
  Bohuslän).</p>

  <p>But, if so, then the objection that the Götar are not a sufficiently
  maritime people becomes untenable. For precisely to this region belong
  the earliest records of maritime warfare to be found in the north of
  Europe, possibly the earliest in Europe. The smooth rocks of Bohuslän are
  covered with incised pictures of the Bronze age: and the favourite
  subject of these is ships and naval encounters. About 120 different
  pictures of ships and sea fights are reproduced by one scholar alone<a
  name="NtA688" href="#Nt688"><sup>[688]</sup></a>. And at the present day
  this province of Göteborg and Bohus is the most important centre in
  Sweden both of fishery and shipping. Indeed, more than one quarter of the
  total tonnage of the modern Swedish mercantile marine comes from this
  comparatively tiny strip of coast<a name="NtA689"
  href="#Nt689"><sup>[689]</sup></a>.</p>

<p><!-- Page 341 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page341"></a>{341}</span></p>

  <p>It is surely quite absurd to urge that the men of this coast could not
  have harried the Frisians in the manner in which Hygelac is represented
  as doing. And surely it is equally absurd to urge that the people of this
  coast would not have had to fear a return attack from the Frisians, after
  the downfall of their own kings. The Frisians seem to have been "the
  chief channel of communication between the North and West of Europe<a
  name="NtA690" href="#Nt690"><sup>[690]</sup></a>" before the rise of the
  Scandinavian Vikings, and to have been supreme in the North Sea. The
  Franks were of course a land power, but the Franks, <i>when in alliance
  with the Frisians</i>, were by no means helpless at sea. Gregory of Tours
  tells us that they overthrew Hygelac on land, and <i>then in a sea fight
  annihilated his fleet</i>. Now the poet says that the Geatas may expect
  war when the Franks <i>and Frisians</i> hear of Beowulf's fall. The
  objection that, because they feared the Franks, the Geatas must have been
  reachable by land, depends upon leaving the "and Frisians" out of
  consideration.</p>

  <p>"Now we may look for a time of war" says the messenger "when the fall
  of our king is known among the Franks and Frisians": then he gives a
  brief account of the raid upon the land of the Frisians and concludes:
  "Ever since then has the favour of the Merovingian king been denied us<a
  name="NtA691" href="#Nt691"><sup>[691]</sup></a>." What is there in this
  to indicate whether the raiders came from Jutland, or from the coast of
  the Götar across the Cattegat, 50 miles further off? The messenger goes
  on to anticipate hostility from the Swedes<a name="NtA692"
  href="#Nt692"><sup>[692]</sup></a>. To this, at any rate, the Götar were
  more exposed than the Jutes. Further, he concludes by anticipating the
  utter overthrow of the Geatas<a name="NtA693"
  href="#Nt693"><sup>[693]</sup></a>: and the poet expressly tells us that
  these forebodings were justified<a name="NtA694"
  href="#Nt694"><sup>[694]</sup></a>. There must therefore be a reference
  to some famous national catastrophe. Now the Götar <i>did</i> lose their
  independence, and <i>were</i> incorporated into the Swedish kingdom. When
  did the Jutes suffer any similar downfall at the hands of either
  Frisians, Franks, or Swedes?</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The other geographical and historical arguments urged in favour of the
  Jutes, when carefully scrutinized, are found either <!-- Page 342
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page342"></a>{342}</span>equally
  indecisive, or else actually to tell against the "Jute-theory." Schütte<a
  name="NtA695" href="#Nt695"><sup>[695]</sup></a> thinks that the name
  "Wederas" (applied in <i>Beowulf</i> to the Geatas) is identical with the
  name <i>Eudoses</i> (that of a tribe mentioned by Tacitus, who
  <i>may</i><a name="NtA696" href="#Nt696"><sup>[696]</sup></a> have dwelt
  in Jutland). But this is impossible phonologically: <i>Wederas</i> is
  surely a shortened form of <i>Weder-G&#x113;atas</i>, "the Storm-Geatas."
  Indeed, we have, in favour of the Götar-theory, the fact that the very
  name of the Wederas survives on the Bohuslän coast to this day, in the
  Wäder Öar and the Wäder Fiord.</p>

  <p>Advocates of the "Jute-theory" lay great stress upon the fact that
  Gregory of Tours and the <i>Liber Historiae Francorum</i> call Hygelac a
  Dane<a name="NtA697" href="#Nt697"><sup>[697]</sup></a>: <i>Dani cum rege
  suo Chochilaico</i>. Now, when Gregory wrote in the sixth century, either
  the Jutes were entirely distinct from, and independent of, the Danes, or
  they were not. If they were distinct, how do Gregory's words help the
  "Jute-theory"? He must be simply using "Dane," like the Anglo-Saxon
  historians, for "Scandinavian." But if the Jutes were not distinct from
  the Danes, then we have an argument against the "Jute-theory." For we
  know from <i>Beowulf</i> that the Geatas <i>were</i> quite distinct from
  the Danes<a name="NtA698" href="#Nt698"><sup>[698]</sup></a>, and quite
  independent of them<a name="NtA699"
  href="#Nt699"><sup>[699]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>It is repeatedly urged that the Geatas and Swedes fight <i>ofer
  s&#x1E3;</i><a name="NtA700" href="#Nt700"><sup>[700]</sup></a>. But
  <i>s&#x1E3;</i> can mean a great fresh-water lake, like Lake Wener, just
  as well as the ocean<a name="NtA701" href="#Nt701"><sup>[701]</sup></a>:
  and as a matter of fact we know that the decisive battle did take place
  on Lake Wener, <i>in stagno Waener, á Vænis ísi</i><a name="NtA702"
  href="#Nt702"><sup>[702]</sup></a>. Lake Wener is an obvious battle place
  for Götar and Swedes. They were separated by the great and almost
  impassable forests of "Tived" and "Kolmård," and the lake was their
  simplest way of meeting<a name="NtA703"
  href="#Nt703"><sup>[703]</sup></a>. But it does not equally fit Jutes and
  Swedes.</p>

  <p>It is repeatedly objected that the Götar are remote from the
  Anglo-Saxons<a name="NtA704" href="#Nt704"><sup>[704]</sup></a>.
  Possibly: but remoteness did not prevent <!-- Page 343 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page343"></a>{343}</span>the Anglo-Saxons from
  being interested in heroes of the Huns or Goths or Burgundians or
  Longobards, who were much more<a name="NtA705"
  href="#Nt705"><sup>[705]</sup></a> distant. And the absence of any direct
  connection between the history of the Geatas and the historic Anglo-Saxon
  records, affords a strong presumption that the Geatas <i>were</i> a
  somewhat alien people. If the people of Beowulf, Hygelac, and Hrethel,
  were the same people as the Jutes who colonized Kent and Hampshire, why
  do we never, in the Kentish royal genealogies or elsewhere, find any
  claim to such connection? The Mercians did not so forget their connection
  with the old Offa of Angel, although a much greater space of time had
  intervened. The fact that we have no mention among the ancestors of
  Beowulf and Hygelac of any names which we can connect with the Jutish
  genealogy affords, therefore, a strong presumption that they belonged to
  some other tribe.</p>

  <p>The strongest historical argument for the "Jute-theory" was that
  produced by Bugge. The <i>Ynglinga tal</i> represents Ottar (who is
  certainly the Ohthere of <i>Beowulf</i>) as having fallen in Vendel, and
  this Vendel was clearly understood as being the district of that name in
  North Jutland. The body of this Swedish king was torn asunder by carrion
  birds, and he was remembered as "the Vendel-crow," a mocking nickname
  which pretty clearly goes back to primitive times. Other ancient authors
  attributed this name, not to Ottar, but to his father, who can be
  identified with the Ongentheow of <i>Beowulf</i>. This would seem to
  indicate that the hereditary foes of Ongentheow and the Swedish kings of
  his house were, after all, the Jutes of Vendel.</p>

  <p>But Knut Stjerna has shown that the Vendel from which "Ottar
  Vendel-crow" took his name was probably not the Vendel of Jutland at all,
  but the place of that name north of Uppsala, famous for the splendid
  grave-finds which show it to have been of peculiar importance during our
  period<a name="NtA706" href="#Nt706"><sup>[706]</sup></a>. And subsequent
  research has shown that a huge grave-mound, near this Vendel, is
  mentioned in a record of the seventeenth century as King <!-- Page 344
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page344"></a>{344}</span>Ottar's mound,
  and is still popularly known as the mound of Ottar Vendel-crow<a
  name="NtA707" href="#Nt707"><sup>[707]</sup></a>. But, if so, this story
  of the Vendel-crow, so far from supporting the "Jute-hypothesis," tells
  against it: nothing could be more suitable than Vendel, north of Uppsala,
  as the "last ditch" to which Ongentheow retreated, if we assume his
  adversaries to have been the Götar: but it would not suit the Jutes so
  well.</p>

  <p>An exploration of the mound has proved beyond reasonable doubt that it
  <i>was</i> raised to cover the ashes of Ottar Vendel-crow, the Ohthere of
  <i>Beowulf</i><a name="NtA708" href="#Nt708"><sup>[708]</sup></a>. That
  Ohthere fell in battle against the Geatas there is nothing, in
  <i>Beowulf</i> or elsewhere, to prove. But the fact that his ashes were
  laid in mound at Vendel in Sweden makes it unlikely that he fell in
  battle against the Jutes, and is quite incompatible with what we are told
  in the <i>Ynglinga saga</i> of his body having been torn to pieces by
  carrion fowl on a mound in Vendel in Jutland. It now becomes clear that
  this story, and the tale of the crow of wood made by the Jutlanders in
  mockery of Ottar, is a mere invention to account for the name
  Vendel-crow: the name, as so often, has survived, and a new story has
  grown up to give a reason for the name.</p>

  <p>What "Vendel-crow" originally implied we cannot be quite sure.
  Apparently "Crow" or "Vendel-crow" is used to this day as a nickname for
  the inhabitants of Swedish Vendel. Ottar may have been so called because
  he was buried (possibly because he lived) in Vendel, not, like other
  members of his race, his son and his father, at Old Uppsala. But however
  that may be, what is clear is that, as the name passed from the Swedes to
  those Norwegian and Icelandic writers who have handed it down <!-- Page
  345 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page345"></a>{345}</span>to us,
  Vendel of Sweden was naturally misunderstood as the more familiar Vendel
  of Jutland. Stjerna's conjecture is confirmed. The Swedish king's
  nickname, far from pointing to ancient feuds between Jute and Swede, is
  shown to have nothing whatsoever to do with Jutland.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>It appears, then, that <i>G&#x113;atas</i> is phonologically the
  equivalent of "Götar," but not the equivalent of "Jutes"; that what we
  know of the use of the word "Jutes" (<i>&#x12A;ote</i>, etc.) in Old
  English makes it incredible that a poem of the length of <i>Beowulf</i>
  could be written, concerning their heroes and their wars, without even
  mentioning them by their correct name; that in many respects the
  geographical and historical evidence fits the Götar, but does <i>not</i>
  fit the Jutes; that the instances to the contrary, in which it is claimed
  that the geographical and historical evidence fits the Jutes but does not
  fit the Götar, are all found on examination to be either inconclusive or
  actually to favour the Götar.</p>

<p class="cenhead">F. <i>BEOWULF</i> AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS</p>

  <p>The peat-bogs of Schleswig and Denmark have yielded finds of the first
  importance for English archæology. These "moss-finds" are great
  collections, chiefly of arms and accoutrements, obviously deposited with
  intention. The first of these great discoveries, that of Thorsbjerg, was
  made in the heart of ancient Angel: the site of the next, Nydam, also
  comes within the area probably occupied by either Angles or Jutes; and
  most of the rest of the "moss-finds" were in the closest neighbourhood of
  the old Anglian home. The period of the oldest deposits, as is shown by
  the Roman coins found among them, is hardly before the third century
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span>, and some authorities would make it
  considerably later.</p>

  <p>An account of these discoveries will be found in Engelhardt's
  <i>Denmark in the Early Iron Age</i><a name="NtA709"
  href="#Nt709"><sup>[709]</sup></a>, 1866: a volume which <!-- Page 346
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page346"></a>{346}</span>summarizes the
  results of Engelhardt's investigations during the preceding seven years.
  He had published in Copenhagen <i>Thorsbjerg Mosefund</i>, 1863; <i>Nydam
  Mosefund</i>, 1865. Engelhardt's work at Nydam was interrupted by the war
  of 1864: the finds had to be ceded to Germany, and the exploration was
  continued by German scholars. Engelhardt consoled himself that these
  "subsequent investigations ... do not seem to have been carried on with
  the necessary care and intelligence," and continued his own researches
  within the narrowed frontiers of Denmark, publishing two monographs on
  the mosses of Fünen: <i>Kragehul Mosefund</i>, 1867; <i>Vimose
  Fundet</i>, 1869.</p>

  <p>These deposits, however, obviously belong to a period much earlier
  than that in which <i>Beowulf</i> was written: indeed most of them
  certainly belong to a period earlier than that in which the historic
  events described in <i>Beowulf</i> occurred; so that, close as is their
  relation with Anglian civilization, it is with the civilization of the
  Angles while still on the continent.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The Archæology of <i>Beowulf</i> has been made the subject of special
  study by Knut Stjerna, in a series of articles which appeared between
  1903 and his premature death in 1909. A good service has been done to
  students of <i>Beowulf</i> by Dr Clark Hall in collecting and translating
  Stjerna's essays<a name="NtA710" href="#Nt710"><sup>[710]</sup></a>. They
  are a mine of useful information, and the reproductions of articles from
  Scandinavian grave-finds, with which they are so copiously illustrated,
  are invaluable. The magnificent antiquities from Vendel, now in the
  Stockholm museum, are more particularly laid under contribution<a
  name="NtA711" href="#Nt711"><sup>[711]</sup></a>. Dr Clark Hall added a
  most useful "Index of things mentioned in <i>Beowulf</i><a name="NtA712"
  href="#Nt712"><sup>[712]</sup></a>," well illustrated. Here again the
  illustrations, with few exceptions, are from Scandinavian finds.</p>

<p><!-- Page 347 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page347"></a>{347}</span></p>

  <p>Two weighty arguments as to the origin of <i>Beowulf</i> have been
  based upon archæology. In the first place it has been urged by Dr Clark
  Hall that:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If the poem is read in the light of the evidence which Stjerna has
  marshalled in the essays as to the profusion of gold, the prevalence of
  ring-swords, of boar-helmets, of ring-corslets, and ring-money, it
  becomes clear how strong the distinctively Scandinavian colouring is, and
  how comparatively little of the <i>mise-en-scène</i> must be due to the
  English author<a name="NtA713" href="#Nt713"><sup>[713]</sup></a>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Equally, Prof. Klaeber finds in Stjerna's investigations a strong
  argument for the Scandinavian character of <i>Beowulf</i><a name="NtA714"
  href="#Nt714"><sup>[714]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Now Stjerna, very rightly and naturally, drew his illustrations of
  <i>Beowulf</i> from those Scandinavian, and especially Swedish,
  grave-finds which he knew so well: and very valuable those illustrations
  are. But it does not follow, because the one archæologist who has chosen
  to devote his knowledge so wholeheartedly to the elucidation of
  <i>Beowulf</i> was a Scandinavian, using Scandinavian material, that
  therefore <i>Beowulf</i> is Scandinavian. This, however, is the inference
  which Stjerna himself was apt to draw, and which is still being drawn
  from his work. Stjerna speaks of our poem as a monument raised by the
  Geatas to the memory of their saga-renowned king<a name="NtA715"
  href="#Nt715"><sup>[715]</sup></a>, though he allows that certain
  features of the poem, such as the dragon-fight<a name="NtA716"
  href="#Nt716"><sup>[716]</sup></a>, are of Anglo-Saxon origin.</p>

  <p>Of course, it must be allowed that accounts such as those of the
  fighting between Swedes and Geatas, if they are historical (and they
  obviously are), must have originated from eyewitnesses of the
  Scandinavian battles: but I doubt if there is anything in <i>Beowulf</i>
  so purely Scandinavian as to compel us to assume that any line of the
  story, in the poetical form in which we now have it, was
  <i>necessarily</i> composed in Scandinavia. Even if it could be shown
  that the conditions depicted in <i>Beowulf</i> can be better illustrated
  from the grave-finds of Vendel in Sweden than from English diggings, this
  would not prove <i>Beowulf</i> Scandinavian. Modern scientific archæology
  is surely based on chronology as well as geography. The English finds
  date from <!-- Page 348 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page348"></a>{348}</span>the period before 650 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>, and the Vendel finds from the period after.
  <i>Beowulf</i> might well show similarity rather with contemporary art
  abroad than with the art of earlier generations at home. For intercourse
  was more general than is always realized. It was not merely trade and
  plunder which spread fashions from nation to nation. There were the
  presents of arms which Tacitus mentions as sent, not only privately, but
  with public ceremony, from one tribe to another<a name="NtA717"
  href="#Nt717"><sup>[717]</sup></a>. Similar presentations are indicated
  in <i>Beowulf</i><a name="NtA718" href="#Nt718"><sup>[718]</sup></a>; we
  find them equally at the court of the Ostrogothic Theodoric<a
  name="NtA719" href="#Nt719"><sup>[719]</sup></a>; Charles the Great sent
  to Offa of Mercia <i>unum balteum et unum gladium huniscum</i><a
  name="NtA720" href="#Nt720"><sup>[720]</sup></a>; according to the famous
  story in the <i>Heimskringla</i>, Athelstan sent to Harold Fairhair of
  Norway a sword and belt arrayed with gold and silver; Athelstan gave
  Harold's son Hakon a sword which was the best that ever came to Norway<a
  name="NtA721" href="#Nt721"><sup>[721]</sup></a>. It is not surprising,
  then, if we find parallels between English poetry and Scandinavian
  grave-finds, both apparently dating from about the year 700 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> But I do not think that there is any
  <i>special</i> resemblance, though, both in <i>Beowulf</i> and in the
  Vendel graves, there is a profusion lacking in the case of the simpler
  Anglo-Saxon tomb-furniture.</p>

  <p>Let us examine the five points of special resemblance, alleged by Dr
  Clark Hall, on the basis of Stjerna's studies.</p>

  <p>"The profusion of gold." Gold is indeed lavishly used in
  <i>Beowulf</i>: the golden treasure found in the dragon's lair was so
  bulky that it had to be transported by waggon. And, certainly, gold is
  found in greater profusion in Swedish than in English graves: the most
  casual visitor to the Stockholm museum must be impressed by the
  magnificence of the exhibits there. But, granting gold to have been rarer
  in England than in Sweden, I cannot grant Stjerna's contention that
  therefore an English poet could not have conceived the idea of a vast
  gold hoard<a name="NtA722" href="#Nt722"><sup>[722]</sup></a>; or that,
  even if the poet does deck his warriors with gold somewhat more
  sumptuously than was actually the case in England, <!-- Page 349 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page349"></a>{349}</span>we can draw any
  argument from it. For, if the dragon in <i>Beowulf</i> guards a treasure,
  so equally does the typical dragon of Old English proverbial lore<a
  name="NtA723" href="#Nt723"><sup>[723]</sup></a>. Beowulf is spoken of as
  <i>gold-wlanc</i>, but the typical thegn in <i>Finnsburg</i> is called
  <i>gold-hladen</i><a name="NtA724" href="#Nt724"><sup>[724]</sup></a>.
  The sword found by Beowulf in the hall of Grendel's mother has a golden
  hilt, but the English proverb had it that "gold is in its place on a
  man's sword<a name="NtA725" href="#Nt725"><sup>[725]</sup></a>." Heorot
  is hung with golden tapestry, but gold-inwoven fabric has been unearthed
  from Saxon graves at Taplow, and elsewhere in England<a name="NtA726"
  href="#Nt726"><sup>[726]</sup></a>. Gold glitters in other poems quite as
  lavishly as in <i>Beowulf</i>, sometimes more so. Widsith made a hobby of
  collecting golden <i>b&#x113;agas</i>. The subject of <i>Waldere</i> is a
  fight for treasure. The byrnie of Waldere<a name="NtA727"
  href="#Nt727"><sup>[727]</sup></a> is adorned with gold: so is that of
  Holofernes in <i>Judith</i><a name="NtA728"
  href="#Nt728"><sup>[728]</sup></a>, so is that of the typical warrior in
  the <i>Elene</i><a name="NtA729" href="#Nt729"><sup>[729]</sup></a>. Are
  all these poems Scandinavian?</p>

  <p>"The prevalence of ring-swords." We know that swords were sometimes
  fitted with a ring in the hilt<a name="NtA730"
  href="#Nt730"><sup>[730]</sup></a>. It is not clear whether the object of
  this ring was to fasten the hilt by a strap to the wrist, for convenience
  in fighting (as has been the custom with the cavalry sword in modern
  times) or whether it was used to attach the "peace bands," by which the
  hilt of the sword was sometimes fixed to the scabbard, when only being
  worn ceremonially<a name="NtA731" href="#Nt731"><sup>[731]</sup></a>. The
  word <i>hring-m&#x1E3;l</i>, applied three times to the sword in
  <i>Beowulf</i>, has been interpretated as a reference to these
  "ring-swords," though it is quite conceivable that it may refer only to
  the damascening of the sword with a ringed pattern<a name="NtA732"
  href="#Nt732"><sup>[732]</sup></a>. Assuming that the reference in
  <i>Beowulf</i> <i>is</i> to a "ring-sword," Stjerna illustrates the
  allusion from seven ring-swords, or fragments of ring-swords, found in
  Sweden. But, as Dr Clark Hall himself points out (whilst oddly enough
  accepting this argument <!-- Page 350 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page350"></a>{350}</span>as proof of the Scandinavian colouring of
  <i>Beowulf</i>) four ring-swords at least have been found in England<a
  name="NtA733" href="#Nt733"><sup>[733]</sup></a>. And these English
  swords are <i>real</i> ring-swords; that is to say, the pommel is
  furnished with a ring, within which another ring moves (in the oldest
  type of sword) quite freely. This freedom of movement seems, however, to
  be gradually restricted, and in one of these English swords the two rings
  are made in one and the same piece. In the Swedish swords, however, this
  restriction is carried further, and the two rings are represented by a
  knob growing out of a circular base. Another sword of this "knob"-type
  has recently been found in a Frankish tomb<a name="NtA734"
  href="#Nt734"><sup>[734]</sup></a>, and yet another in the Rhineland<a
  name="NtA735" href="#Nt735"><sup>[735]</sup></a>. It seems to be agreed
  among archæologists that the English type, as found in Kent, is the
  original, and that the Swedish and continental "ring-swords" are merely
  imitations, in which the ring has become conventionalized into a knob<a
  name="NtA736" href="#Nt736"><sup>[736]</sup></a>. But, if so, how can the
  mention of a ring-sword in <i>Beowulf</i> (if indeed that be the meaning
  of <i>hring-m&#x1E3;l</i>) prove Scandinavian colouring? If it proved
  anything (which it does not) it would tend to prove the reverse, and to
  locate <i>Beowulf</i> in Kent, where the true ring-swords have been
  found.</p>

  <p>"The prevalence of boar-helmets." It is true that several
  representations of warriors wearing boar-helmets have been found in
  Scandinavia. But the only certainly Anglo-Saxon <!-- Page 351 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page351"></a>{351}</span>helmet yet found in
  England has a boar-crest<a name="NtA737"
  href="#Nt737"><sup>[737]</sup></a>; and this is, I believe, the only
  actual boar-helmet yet found. How then can the boar-helmets of
  <i>Beowulf</i> show Scandinavian rather than Anglo-Saxon origin?</p>

  <p>"The prevalence of ring-corslets." It is true that only one trace of a
  byrnie, and that apparently not of ring-mail, has so far been found in an
  Anglo-Saxon grave. (We have somewhat more abundant remains from the
  period prior to the migration to England: a peculiarly fine corslet of
  ring-mail, with remains of some nine others, was found in the moss at
  Thorsbjerg<a name="NtA738" href="#Nt738"><sup>[738]</sup></a> in the
  midst of the ancient Anglian continental home; and other ring-corslets
  have been found in the neighbourhood of Angel, at Vimose<a name="NtA739"
  href="#Nt739"><sup>[739]</sup></a> in Fünen.) But, for the period when
  <i>Beowulf</i> must have been composed, the ring-corslet is almost as
  rare in Scandinavia as in England<a name="NtA740"
  href="#Nt740"><sup>[740]</sup></a>; the artist, however, seems to be
  indicating a byrnie upon many of the warriors depicted on the Vendel helm
  (Grave 14: seventh century). Equally, in England, warriors are
  represented on the Franks Casket as wearing the byrnie: also the laws of
  Ine (688-95) make it clear that the byrnie was by no means unknown<a
  name="NtA741" href="#Nt741"><sup>[741]</sup></a>. Other Old English
  poems, certainly not Scandinavian, mention the ring-byrnie. How then can
  the mention of it in <i>Beowulf</i> be a proof of Scandinavian
  origin?</p>

  <p>"The prevalence of ring-money." Before minted money became current,
  rings were used everywhere among the Teutonic peoples. Gold rings,
  <i>intertwined</i> so as to form a chain, have been found throughout
  Scandinavia, presumably for use as a medium of exchange. The term
  <i>locenra b&#x113;aga</i> (gen. plu.) occurs in <i>Beowulf</i>, and this
  is interpreted by Stjerna as "rings <i>intertwined or locked</i>
  together<a name="NtA742" href="#Nt742"><sup>[742]</sup></a>." But
  <i>locen</i> in <i>Beowulf</i> need not have the meaning of
  "intertwined"; it occurs elsewhere in Old English of a single jewel,
  <i>sincgim locen</i><a name="NtA743" href="#Nt743"><sup>[743]</sup></a>.
  Further, even if <i>locen</i> does mean <!-- Page 352 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page352"></a>{352}</span>"intertwined," such
  intertwined rings are not limited to Scandinavia proper. They have been
  found in Schleswig<a name="NtA744" href="#Nt744"><sup>[744]</sup></a>.
  And almost the very phrase in <i>Beowulf</i>, <i>londes ne locenra
  b&#x113;aga</i><a name="NtA745" href="#Nt745"><sup>[745]</sup></a>,
  recurs in the <i>Andreas</i>. The phrase there may be imitated from
  <i>Beowulf</i>, but, equally, the phrase in <i>Beowulf</i> may be
  imitated from some earlier poem. In fact, it is part of the traditional
  poetic diction: but its occurrence in the <i>Andreas</i> shows that it
  cannot be used as an argument of Scandinavian origin.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Whilst, therefore, accepting with gratitude the numerous illustrations
  which Stjerna has drawn from Scandinavian grave-finds, we must be careful
  not to read a Scandinavian colouring into features of <i>Beowulf</i>
  which are at least as much English as Scandinavian, such as the
  ring-sword or the boar-helmet or the ring-corslet.</p>

  <p>There is, as is noted above, a certain atmosphere of profusion and
  wealth about some Scandinavian grave-finds, which corresponds much more
  nearly with the wealthy life depicted in <i>Beowulf</i> than does the
  comparatively meagre tomb-furniture of England. But we must remember
  that, after the spread of Christianity in the first half of the seventh
  century, the custom of burying articles with the bodies of the dead
  naturally ceased, or almost ceased, in England. Scandinavia continued
  heathen for another four hundred years, and it was during these years
  that the most magnificent deposits were made. As Stjerna himself points
  out, "a steadily increasing luxury in the appointment of graves" is to be
  found in Scandinavia in these centuries before the introduction of
  Christianity there. When we find in Scandinavia things (complete ships,
  for example) which we do not find in England, we owe this, partly to the
  nature of the soil in which they were embedded, but also to the
  continuance of such burial customs after they had died out in
  England.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Helm and byrnie were not necessarily unknown, or even very rare in
  England, simply because it was not the custom to bury them with the dead.
  On the other hand, the frequent mention of them in <i>Beowulf</i> does
  not imply that they were common: for <!-- Page 353 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page353"></a>{353}</span><i>Beowulf</i> deals
  only with the aristocratic adherents of a court, and even in
  <i>Beowulf</i> fine specimens of the helm and byrnie are spoken of as
  things which a king seeks far and wide to procure for his retainers<a
  name="NtA746" href="#Nt746"><sup>[746]</sup></a>. We cannot, therefore,
  argue that there is any discrepancy. However, if we do so argue, it would
  merely prove, not that <i>Beowulf</i> is Scandinavian as opposed to
  English, but that it is comparatively late in date. Tacitus emphasizes
  the fact that spear and shield were the Teutonic weapons, that helmet and
  corslet were hardly known<a name="NtA747"
  href="#Nt747"><sup>[747]</sup></a>. Pagan graves show that at any rate
  they were hardly known <i>as tomb-furniture</i> in England in the fifth,
  sixth, and early seventh centuries. The introduction of Christianity, and
  the intercourse with the South which it involved, certainly led to the
  growth of pomp and wealth in England, till the early eighth century
  became "the golden age of Anglo-Saxon England."</p>

  <p>It might therefore conceivably be argued that <i>Beowulf</i> reflects
  the comparative abundance of early Christian England, as opposed to the
  more primitive heathen simplicity; but to argue a Scandinavian origin
  from the profusion of <i>Beowulf</i> admits of an easy <i>reductio ad
  absurdum</i>. For the same arguments would prove a heathen, Scandinavian
  origin for the <i>Andreas</i>, the <i>Elene</i>, the <i>Exodus</i>, or
  even for the Franks Casket, despite its Anglo-Saxon inscription and
  Christian carvings.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>However, though the absence of helm and byrnie from Anglo-Saxon graves
  does not prove that these arms were not used by the living in heathen
  times, one thing it assuredly <i>does</i> prove: that the Anglo-Saxons in
  heathen times did not sacrifice helm and byrnie recklessly in funeral
  pomp. And this brings us to the second argument as to the origin of
  <i>Beowulf</i> which has been based on archæology.</p>

  <p>Something has been said above of this second contention<a
  name="NtA748" href="#Nt748"><sup>[748]</sup></a>&mdash;that the accuracy
  of the account of Beowulf's funeral is confirmed in every point by
  archæological evidence: that it must <!-- Page 354 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page354"></a>{354}</span>therefore have been
  composed within living memory of a time when ceremonies of this kind were
  still actually in use in England: and that therefore we cannot date
  <i>Beowulf</i> later than the third or fourth decade of the seventh
  century.</p>

  <p>To begin with; the pyre in <i>Beowulf</i> is represented as hung with
  helmets, bright byrnies, and shields. Now it is impossible to say exactly
  how the funeral pyres were equipped in England. But we <i>do</i> know how
  the buried bodies were equipped. And (although inhumation cemeteries are
  much more common than cremation cemeteries) all the graves that have been
  opened have so far yielded only one case of a helmet and byrnie being
  buried with the warrior, and one other very doubtful case of a helmet
  without the byrnie. Abroad, instances are somewhat more common, but still
  of great rarity. For such things could ill be spared. Charles the Great
  forbade the export of byrnies from his dominions. Worn by picked
  champions fighting in the forefront, they might well decide the issue of
  a battle. In the mounds where we have reason to think that the great
  chiefs mentioned in <i>Beowulf</i>, Eadgils or Ohthere, lie buried, any
  trace of weapons was conspicuously absent among the burnt remains.
  Nevertheless, the belief that his armour would be useful to the champion
  in the next life, joined perhaps with a feeling that it was unlucky, or
  unfair on the part of the survivor to deprive the dead of his personal
  weapons, led in heathen times to the occasional burial of these treasures
  with the warrior who owned them. The fifth century tomb of Childeric I,
  when discovered twelve centuries later, was found magnificently
  furnished&mdash;the prince had been buried with treasure and much
  equipment<a name="NtA749" href="#Nt749"><sup>[749]</sup></a>, sword,
  scramasax<a name="NtA750" href="#Nt750"><sup>[750]</sup></a>, axe, spear.
  But these were his own. Similarly, piety might have demanded that Beowulf
  should be burnt with his full equipment. But would the pyre have been
  hung with helmets and byrnies? Whose? Were the thegns asked to sacrifice
  theirs, and go naked into the next fight in honour of their lord? If so,
  what archæological authority have we for such a custom in England?</p>

<p><!-- Page 355 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page355"></a>{355}</span></p>

  <p>Then the barrow is built, and the vast treasure of the dragon (which
  included "many a helmet<a name="NtA751"
  href="#Nt751"><sup>[751]</sup></a>") placed in it. Now there are
  instances of articles which have not passed through the fire being placed
  in or upon or around an urn with the cremated bones<a name="NtA752"
  href="#Nt752"><sup>[752]</sup></a>. But is there any instance of the
  thing being done on this scale&mdash;of a wholesale burning of helmets
  and byrnies followed by a burial of huge treasure? If so, one would like
  to know when, and where. If not, how can it be argued that the account in
  <i>Beowulf</i> is one of which "the accuracy is confirmed in every point
  by archæological or contemporary literary evidence?" Rather we must say,
  with Knut Stjerna, that it is "too much of a good thing<a name="NtA753"

<p class="cenhead"><i>Scandinavian Burial Mounds</i></p>

  <p>The three great "Kings' Mounds" at Old Uppsala were explored between
  1847 and 1874: cremated remains from them can be seen in the Stockholm
  Museum. An account of the tunnelling, and of the complicated structure of
  the mounds, was given in 1876 by the Swedish State-Antiquary<a
  name="NtA756" href="#Nt756"><sup>[756]</sup></a>. From these finds Knut
  Stjerna dated the oldest of the "Kings' Mounds" about 500 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span><a name="NtA757"
  href="#Nt757"><sup>[757]</sup></a>, and the others somewhat later. Now,
  as we are definitely told that Athils (Eadgils) and the two kings who
  figure in the list of Swedish monarchs as his grandfather and
  great-grandfather (Aun and Egil) were "laid in mound" at Uppsala<a
  name="NtA758" href="#Nt758"><sup>[758]</sup></a>, and as the chronology
  agrees, it seems only reasonable to conclude that the three Kings' Mounds
  were raised over these three kings<a name="NtA759"
  href="#Nt759"><sup>[759]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>That Athils' father Ottar (Ohthere) was not regarded as having been
  buried at Uppsala is abundantly clear from the account given of his
  death, and of his nickname Vendel-crow<a name="NtA760"
  href="#Nt760"><sup>[760]</sup></a>. A mound near Vendel north of Uppsala
  is known by his name. Such names are often the result of quite modern
  antiquarian conjecture: but that such is not the case here was proved by
  the recent discovery that an antiquarian survey (preserved in <span
  class="scac">MS</span> in the Royal Library at Stockholm) dating from
  1677, mentions in Vendel "widh Hussby, [en] stor jorde högh, som heeter
  Otters högen<a name="NtA761" href="#Nt761"><sup>[761]</sup></a>." An
  exploration of Ottar's mound showed a striking similarity with the
  Uppsala mounds. The structure was the same, a cairn of stones covered
  over with earth; the <!-- Page 357 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page357"></a>{357}</span>cremated remains were similar, there were
  abundant traces of burnt animals, a comb, half-spherical draughts with
  two round holes bored in the flat side, above all, there was in neither
  case any trace of weapons. In Ottar's mound a gold Byzantine coin was
  found, pierced, having evidently been used as an ornament. It can be
  dated 477-8; it is much worn, but such coins seldom remained in the North
  in use for a century after their minting<a name="NtA762"
  href="#Nt762"><sup>[762]</sup></a>. Ottar's mound obviously, then,
  belongs to the same period as the Uppsala mounds, and confirms the date
  attributed by Stjerna to the oldest of those mounds, about 500 <span

  <p><b>The Sword.</b> The sword of the Anglo-Saxon pagan period (from the
  fifth to the seventh century) "is deficient in quality as a blade, and
  also ... in the character of its hilt<a name="NtA763"
  href="#Nt763"><sup>[763]</sup></a>." In this it contrasts with the sword
  found in the peat-bogs of Schleswig from an earlier period: "these swords
  of the Schleswig moss-finds are much better weapons<a name="NtA764"
  href="#Nt764"><sup>[764]</sup></a>," as well as with the later Viking
  sword of the ninth or tenth century, which "is a remarkably effective and
  well-considered implement<a name="NtA765"
  href="#Nt765"><sup>[765]</sup></a>." It has been suggested that both the
  earlier Schleswig swords and the later Viking swords (which bear a
  considerable likeness to each other, as against the inferior Anglo-Saxon
  sword) are the product of intercourse with Romanized peoples<a
  name="NtA766" href="#Nt766"><sup>[766]</sup></a>, whilst the typical
  Anglo-Saxon sword "may represent an independent Germanic effort at sword
  making<a name="NtA767" href="#Nt767"><sup>[767]</sup></a>." However this
  may be, it is noteworthy that nowhere in <i>Beowulf</i> do we have any
  hint of the skill of any sword-smith who is regarded as contemporary. A
  good sword is always "an old heirloom," "an ancient treasure<a
  name="NtA768" href="#Nt768"><sup>[768]</sup></a>." The sword of Wiglaf,
  which had belonged to Eanmund, or the sword with which Eofor slays
  Ongentheow, are <!-- Page 358 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page358"></a>{358}</span>described by the phrase <i>ealdsweord
  eotenisc</i>, as if they were weapons of which the secret and origin had
  been lost&mdash;indeed the same phrase is applied to the magic sword
  which Beowulf finds in the hall of Grendel's mother.</p>

  <p>The blade of these ancestral swords was sometimes damascened or
  adorned with wave-like patterns<a name="NtA769"
  href="#Nt769"><sup>[769]</sup></a>. The swords of the Schleswig
  moss-finds are almost all thus adorned with a variegated surface, as
  often are the later Viking swords; but those of the Anglo-Saxon graves
  are <i>not</i>. Is it fanciful to suggest that the reference to
  damascening is a tradition coming down from the time of the earlier sword
  as found in the Nydam moss? A few early swords might have been preserved
  among the invaders as family heirlooms, too precious to be buried with
  the owner, as the product of the local weapon-smith was.</p>

  <p>See, for a full discussion of the sword in <i>Beowulf</i>, Stjerna,
  <i>Hjälmar och svärd i Beovulf</i> (<i>Studier tillägnade O.
  Montelius</i>, Stockholm, pp. 99-120 = <i>Essays</i>, transl. Clark Hall,
  pp. 1-32). The standard treatise on the sword, <i>Den Yngre Jernalders
  Sværd</i>, Bergen, 1889, by A. L. Lorange, deals mainly with a rather
  later period.</p>

  <p><b>The Helmet.</b> The helmet found at Benty Grange in Derbyshire in
  1848 is now in the Sheffield Museum<a name="NtA770"
  href="#Nt770"><sup>[770]</sup></a>: little remains except the boar-crest,
  the nose-piece, and the framework of iron ribs radiating from the crown,
  and fixed to a circle of iron surrounding the brow (perhaps the
  <i>fr&#x113;awr&#x101;sn</i> of <i>Beowulf</i>, 1451). Mr Bateman, the
  discoverer, described the helmet as "coated with narrow plates of horn,
  running in a diagonal direction from the ribs, so as to form a
  herring-bone pattern; the ends were secured by strips of horn, radiating
  in like manner as the iron ribs, to which they were riveted at intervals
  of about an inch and a half: all the rivets had ornamented heads of
  silver on the outside, and on the front rib is a small cross of the same
  metal. Upon the top or crown of the helmet, is an elongated oval brass
  plate, upon which stands the figure of an animal, carved in iron, now
  much rusted, but still a very good representation of a pig: it has bronze
  eyes<a name="NtA771" href="#Nt771"><sup>[771]</sup></a>." Helmets of very
  similar construction, but without the boar, have been found on the
  Continent and in Scandinavia (Vendel, Grave 14, late seventh century).
  The continental helmets often <!-- Page 359 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page359"></a>{359}</span>stand higher<a name="NtA772"
  href="#Nt772"><sup>[772]</sup></a> than the Benty Grange or Vendel
  specimens, being sometimes quite conical (cf. the epithet "war-steep,"
  <i>heaðo-st&#x113;ap</i>, <i>Beowulf</i>). Many of the continental
  helmets are provided with cheek-protections, and these also appear in the
  Scandinavian representations of warriors on the Torslunda plates and
  elsewhere. These side pieces have become detached from the magnificent
  Vendel helmet, which is often shown in engravings without them<a
  name="NtA773" href="#Nt773"><sup>[773]</sup></a>, but they can be seen in
  the Stockholm Museum<a name="NtA774" href="#Nt774"><sup>[774]</sup></a>.
  If it ever possessed them, the Benty Grange helmet has lost these side
  pieces. Such cheek-protections are, however, represented, together with
  the nose-protection, on the head of one of the warriors depicted on the
  Franks Casket. In the Vendel helms, the nose-pieces were connected under
  the eyes with the rim of the helmet, so as to form a mask<a
  href="#Nt774"><sup>[774]</sup></a>; the helmet in <i>Beowulf</i> is
  frequently spoken of as the battle-mask<a name="NtA775"
  href="#Nt775"><sup>[775]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Both helmet and boar-crest were sometimes gold-adorned<a name="NtA776"
  href="#Nt776"><sup>[776]</sup></a>: the golden boar was a symbol of the
  god Freyr: some magic protective power is still, in <i>Beowulf</i><a
  name="NtA777" href="#Nt777"><sup>[777]</sup></a>, felt to adhere to these
  swine-likenesses, as it was in the days of Tacitus<a name="NtA778"
  href="#Nt778"><sup>[778]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>In Scandinavia, the Torslunda plates show the helmet with a
  boar-crest: the Vendel helmet has representations of warriors whose
  crests have an animal's head tailing off to a mere rim or roll: this may
  be the <i>walu</i> or <i>wala</i> which keeps watch over the head in
  <i>Beowulf</i><a name="NtA779" href="#Nt779"><sup>[779]</sup></a>. The
  helmet was bound fast to the head<a name="NtA780"
  href="#Nt780"><sup>[780]</sup></a>; exactly how, we do not know.</p>

  depends on a dating of the Benty Grange helmet which is by no means
  generally accepted.</p>

  <p><b>The Corslet.</b> This in <i>Beowulf</i> is made of rings<a
  name="NtA781" href="#Nt781"><sup>[781]</sup></a>, twisted and interlaced
  by hand<a name="NtA782" href="#Nt782"><sup>[782]</sup></a>. As stated
  above, the fragments of the only known Anglo-Saxon byrnie were not of
  this type, but rather intended to have been sewn "upon a doublet of
  strong cloth<a name="NtA783" href="#Nt783"><sup>[783]</sup></a>." Byrnies
  were of various lengths, the longer ones reaching to the middle of the
  thigh (<i>byrnan s&#x12B;de</i>, <i>Beow.</i> 1291, cf. <i>loricæ longæ,
  síðar brynjur</i>).</p>

  <p>See Falk, 179; Baldwin Brown, <span class="scac">III</span>. 194.</p>

  <p><b>The Spear.</b> Spear and shield were the essential Germanic weapons
  in the days of Tacitus, and they are the weapons most commonly found in
  Old English tombs. The spear-shaft has generally decayed, analysis of
  fragments surviving show that it was frequently of ash<a name="NtA784"
  href="#Nt784"><sup>[784]</sup></a>. The butt-end of the spear was
  frequently furnished with an iron tip, and the distance of this from the
  spear-head, and the size of the socket, show the spear-shaft to have been
  six or seven feet long, and three-quarters of an inch to one inch in
  diameter.</p>

  <p>See Falk, 66-90; Baldwin Brown, <span class="scac">III</span>,
  234-41.</p>

  <p><b>The Shield.</b> Several round shields were preserved on the Gokstad
  ship, and in the deposits of an earlier period at Thorsbjerg and Nydam.
  These are formed of boards fastened together, often only a quarter of an
  inch thick, and not strengthened or braced in any way, bearing out the
  contemptuous description of the painted German shield which Tacitus puts
  into the mouth of Germanicus<a name="NtA785"
  href="#Nt785"><sup>[785]</sup></a>. It was, however, intended that the
  shield should be light. It was easily pierced, but, by a rapid twist, the
  foe's sword could be broken or wrenched from his hand. Thus we are told
  how Gunnar gave his shield a twist, as his adversary thrust his sword
  through it, and so snapped off his sword at the hilt<a name="NtA786"
  href="#Nt786"><sup>[786]</sup></a>. The shield was held by a bar,
  crossing a hole some four inches wide cut in the middle. The hand was
  protected by a hollow conical boss or umbo, fixed to the wood by its
  brim, but projecting considerably. In England the wood of the shield has
  always perished, but a large number of bosses have been preserved. The
  boss seems to have been called <i>rond</i>, a word which is also used for
  the shield as a whole. In <i>Beowulf</i>, 2673, <i>Gifts of Men</i>, 65,
  the meaning "boss" suits <i>rond</i> best, also in <i>rand sceal on
  scylde, fæst fingra gebeorh</i> (<i>Cotton. Gnomic Verses</i>, 37-8). But
  the original meaning of <i>rand</i> must have been the circular rim round
  the edge, and this <!-- Page 361 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page361"></a>{361}</span>meaning it retains in Icelandic (Falk,
  131). The linden wood was sometimes bound with bast, whence <i>scyld
  (sceal) gebunden, l&#x113;oht linden bord</i> (<i>Exeter Gnomic
  Verses</i>, 94-5).</p>

  <p><b>The Bow</b> is a weapon of much less importance in <i>Beowulf</i>
  than the spear. Few traces of the bow have survived from Anglo-Saxon
  England, though many wooden long-bows have been preserved in the
  moss-finds in a remarkably fine state. They are of yew, some over six
  feet long, and in at least one instance tipped with horn. The bow
  entirely of horn was, of course, well known in the East, and in classical
  antiquity, but I do not think traces of any horn-bow have been discovered
  in the North. It was a difficult weapon to manage, as the suitors of
  Penelope found to their cost. Possibly that is why Hæthcyn is represented
  as killing his brother Herebeald accidentally with a horn-bow: he could
  not manage the exotic weapon.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>The Hall</i></p>

  <p>It may perhaps be the fact that in the church of Sta. Maria de
  Naranco, in the north of Spain, we have the hall of a Visigothic king
  driven north by the Mohammedan invasion. But, even if this surmise<a
  name="NtA787" href="#Nt787"><sup>[787]</sup></a> be correct, the
  structure of a stone hall of about 750 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>
  gives us little information as to the wooden halls of early Anglo-Saxon
  times. Heorot is clearly built of timber, held together by iron clamps<a
  name="NtA788" href="#Nt788"><sup>[788]</sup></a>. These halls were
  oblong, and a famous passage in Bede<a name="NtA789"
  href="#Nt789"><sup>[789]</sup></a> makes it clear that, at any rate at
  the time of the Conversion, the hall had a door at both ends, and the
  fire burnt in the middle. (The smoke escaped through a hole in the roof,
  through which probably most of the light came, for windows were few or
  none.) The <i>Finnsburg Fragment</i> also implies two doors. Further
  indications can be drawn from references to the halls of Norse chiefs.
  The Scandinavian hall was divided by rows of wooden pillars into a
  central nave and side aisles. The pillars in the centre were known as the
  "high-seat pillars." Rows of seats ran down the length of the hall on
  each side. The central position, facing the high-seat pillars and the
  fire, was the most honourable. The place of honour for the chief guest
  was opposite: and it is quite clear that in <i>Beowulf</i> also the guest
  did not sit next his host<a name="NtA790"
  href="#Nt790"><sup>[790]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Other points we may note about Heorot, are the tapestry with which its
  walls are draped<a name="NtA791" href="#Nt791"><sup>[791]</sup></a>, and
  the paved and variegated floor<a name="NtA792"
  href="#Nt792"><sup>[792]</sup></a>. Unlike so <!-- Page 362 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page362"></a>{362}</span>many later halls,
  Heorot has a floor little, if anything, raised above the ground: horses
  can be brought in<a name="NtA793" href="#Nt793"><sup>[793]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>In later times, in Iceland, the arrangement of the hall was changed,
  and the house consisted of many rooms; but these were formed, not by
  partitioning the hall, but by building several such halls side by side:
  the <i>stufa</i> or hall proper, the <i>skáli</i> or sleeping hall,
  <i>etc.</i></p>

  <p>See M. Heyne, <i>Ueber die Lage und Construction der Halle Heorot</i>,
  Paderborn, 1864, where the scanty information about Heorot is collected,
  and supplemented with some information about Anglo-Saxon building. For
  the Icelandic hall see Valtyr Guðmundsson, <i>Privatboligen på Island i
  Sagatiden</i>, København, 1889. This has been summarized, in a more
  popular form, in a chapter on <i>Den islandske Bolig i Fristatstiden</i>,
  contributed by Guðmundsson to Rosenberg's <i>Træk af Livet paa Island i
  Fristatstiden</i>, 1894 (pp. 251-74). Here occurs the picture of an
  Icelandic hall which has been so often reproduced&mdash;by Olrik,
  Holthausen, and in <i>Beowulf</i>-translations. But it is a conjectural
  picture, and we can by no means assume all its details for Heorot.
  Rhamm's colossal work is only for the initiated, but is useful for
  consultation on special points (<i>Ethnographische Beiträge zur

<p class="cenhead"><i>Ships</i></p>

  <p>In a tumulus near Snape in Suffolk, opened in 1862, there were
  discovered, with burnt bones and remains thought to be of Anglo-Saxon
  date, a large number of rivets which, from the positions in which they
  were found, seemed to give evidence of a boat 48 feet long by over nine
  feet wide<a name="NtA794" href="#Nt794"><sup>[794]</sup></a>. A boat,
  similar in dimensions, but better preserved, was unearthed near Bruges in
  1899, and the ribs, mast and rudder removed to the Gruuthuuse Museum<a
  name="NtA795" href="#Nt795"><sup>[795]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Three boats were discovered in the peat-moss at Nydam in Schleswig in
  1863, by Engelhardt. The most important is the "Nydam boat,"
  clinker-built (i.e. with overlapping planks), of oak, 77 feet [23.5 m.]
  long, by some 11 [3.4 m.] broad, with rowlocks for fourteen oars down
  each side. There was no trace of any mast. Planks and framework had been
  held together, partly by iron bolts, and partly by ropes of bast. The
  boat had fallen to pieces, and had to be laboriously put together in the
  museum at Flensborg. Another boat was quite fragmentary, but a third
  boat, of fir, was found tolerably complete. Then the war of 1864 ended
  Engelhardt's labours at Nydam.</p>

  </div>

<p><!-- Page 363 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page363"></a>{363}</span></p>

  <p>The oak-boat was removed to Kiel, where it now is.</p>

  <p>The fir-boat was allowed to decay: many of the pieces of the oak-boat
  had been rotten and had of necessity been restored in facsimile, and it
  is much less complete than might be supposed from the numerous
  reproductions, based upon the fine engraving by Magnus Petersen. The
  rustic with a spade, there depicted as gazing at the boat, is apt to give
  a wrong impression that it was dug out intact<a name="NtA796"
  href="#Nt796"><sup>[796]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Such was, however, actually the case with regard to the ship excavated
  from the big mound at Gokstad, near Christiania, by Nicolaysen, in 1880.
  This was fitted both as a rowing and sailing ship; it was 66 feet [20.1
  m.] long on the keel, 78 feet [23.8 m.] from fore to aft and nearly 17
  feet [5.1 m.] broad, and was clinker-built, out of a much larger number
  of oaken planks than the Nydam ship. It had rowlocks for sixteen oars
  down each side, the gunwale was lined with shields, some of them well
  preserved, which had been originally painted alternately black and
  yellow. The find owed its extraordinary preservation to the blue clay in
  which it was embedded. Its discoverer wrote, with pardonable pride:
  "Certain it is that we shall not disinter any craft which, in respect of
  model and workmanship, will outrival that of Gokstad<a name="NtA797"
  href="#Nt797"><sup>[797]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p>Yet the prophecy was destined to prove false: for on Aug. 8, 1903, a
  farmer came into the National Museum at Christiania to tell the curator,
  Prof. Gustafson, that he had discovered traces of a boat on his farm at
  Oseberg. Gustafson found that the task was too great to be begun so late
  in the year: the digging out of the ship, and its removal to Christiania,
  occupied from just before Midsummer to just before Christmas of 1904. The
  potter's clay in which the ship was buried had preserved it, if possible,
  better than the Gokstad ship: but the movement of the soft subsoil had
  squeezed and broken both ship and contents. The ship was taken out of the
  earth in nearly two thousand fragments. These were carefully numbered and
  marked: each piece was treated, bent back into its right shape, and the
  ship was put together again plank by plank, as when it was first built.
  With the exception of a piece about half a yard long, five or six little
  bits let in, and one of the beams, the ship as it stands now consists of
  the original woodwork. Two-thirds of the rivets are the old ones. Till
  his death in 1915 Gustafson was occupied in treating and preparing for
  exhibition first the ship, and then its extraordinarily rich contents: a
  waggon and sledges beautifully carved, beds, chests, kitchen utensils
  which had been buried with the princess who had owned them. A full
  account of the find is only now being published<a name="NtA798"
  href="#Nt798"><sup>[798]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The Oseberg ship is the pleasure boat of a royal lady: clinker-built,
  of oak, exquisitely carved, intended not for long voyages but for the
  land-locked waters of the fiord, 70½ feet [21.5 m.] long by some 16½ feet
  [5 m.] broad. There are holes for fifteen oars down each side, and the
  ship carried mast and sail.</p>

  <p>The upper part of the prow had been destroyed, but sufficient
  fragments have been found to show that it ended in the head of a

  at Stockholm. This is supposed to date from about the year 1000<a
  name="NtA802" href="#Nt802"><sup>[802]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The Gokstad and Oseberg ships, together with the ship of Tune, a much
  less complete specimen (unearthed in 1867, and found like the others on
  the shore of the Christiania fiord) owe their preservation to the clay,
  and the skill of Scandinavian antiquaries. Yet they are but three out of
  thousands of ship- or boat-burials. Schetelig enumerates 552 known
  instances from Norway alone. Often traces of the iron rivets are all that
  remain.</p>

  <p>Ships preserved from the Baltic coast of Germany can be seen at
  Königsberg, Danzig and Stettin; they are smaller and apparently later;
  the best, that of Brösen, was destroyed.</p>

  <p>The seamanship of <i>Beowulf</i> is removed by centuries from that of
  the (? fourth or fifth century) Nydam boat, which not only has no mast or
  proper keel, but is so built as to be little suited for sailing. In
  <i>Beowulf</i> the sea is a "sail-road," the word "to row" occurs only in
  the sense of "swim," sailing is assumed as the means by which Beowulf
  travels between the land of the Geatas and that of the Danes. Though he
  voyages with but fourteen companions, the ship is big enough to carry
  back four horses. How the sail may have been arranged is shown in many
  inscribed stones of the eighth to the tenth centuries: notably those of
  Stenkyrka<a name="NtA803" href="#Nt803"><sup>[803]</sup></a>, Högbro<a
  name="NtA804" href="#Nt804"><sup>[804]</sup></a>, and Tjängvide<a
  name="NtA805" href="#Nt805"><sup>[805]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The Oseberg and Gokstad ships are no doubt later than the composition
  of <i>Beowulf</i>. But it is when looking at the Oseberg ship, especially

  <p>That Leire was the royal town, not merely of Rolf Kraki, but of Rolf's
  predecessors as well, is stated in the <i>Skjoldunga Saga</i>, extant in
  the Latin abstract of Arngrim Jonsson: <i>Scioldus in arce Selandiae
  Hledro sedes posuit, quae et sequentium plurimorum regum regia fuit</i>
  (ed. Olrik, København, 1894, p. 23 [105]). Similarly we are told in the
  <i>Ynglinga Saga</i>, concerning Gefion, <i>Hennar fekk Skj&#x1EB;ldr,

  <p>Above all, it is clear from the <i>Annales Lundenses</i> that, in the

<p class="cenhead">H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON</p>

  <p>The obvious interpretation of the name <i>B&#x113;owulf</i> is that
  suggested by Grimm<a name="NtA806" href="#Nt806"><sup>[806]</sup></a>,
  that it means "wolf, or foe, of the bee." Grimm's suggestion was repeated
  independently by Skeat<a name="NtA807"
  href="#Nt807"><sup>[807]</sup></a>, and further reasons for the
  interpretation "bee-foe" have been found by Sweet<a name="NtA808"
  href="#Nt808"><sup>[808]</sup></a> (who had been anticipated by Simrock<a
  name="NtA809" href="#Nt809"><sup>[809]</sup></a> in some of his points),
  by Cosijn<a name="NtA810" href="#Nt810"><sup>[810]</sup></a>, Sievers<a
  name="NtA811" href="#Nt811"><sup>[811]</sup></a>, von Grienberger<a
  name="NtA812" href="#Nt812"><sup>[812]</sup></a>, Panzer<a name="NtA813"
  href="#Nt813"><sup>[813]</sup></a> and Björkman<a name="NtA814"
  href="#Nt814"><sup>[814]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>From the phonological point of view the etymology is a <!-- Page 366
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page366"></a>{366}</span>perfect one,
  but many of those who were convinced that "Beowulf" meant "bee-foe" had
  no satisfactory explanation of "bee-foe" to offer<a name="NtA815"
  href="#Nt815"><sup>[815]</sup></a>. Others, like Bugge, whilst admitting
  that, so far as the form of the words goes, the etymology is
  satisfactory, rejected "bee-foe" because it seemed to them meaningless<a
  name="NtA816" href="#Nt816"><sup>[816]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Yet it is very far from meaningless. "Bee-foe" means "bear." The bear
  has got a name, or nickname, in many northern languages from his habit of
  raiding the hives for honey. The Finnish name for bear is said to be
  "honey-hand": he is certainly called "sweet-foot," <i>sötfot</i>, in
  Sweden, and the Old Slavonic name, "honey-eater," has come to be accepted
  in Russian, not merely as a nickname, but as the regular term for
  "bear."</p>

  <p>And "bear" is an excellent name for a hero of story. The O.E.
  <i>beorn</i>, "warrior, hero, prince" seems originally to have meant
  simply "bear." The bear, says Grimm, "is regarded, in the belief of the
  Old Norse, Slavonic, Finnish and Lapp peoples, as an exalted and holy
  being, endowed with human understanding and the strength of twelve men.
  He is called 'forest-king,' 'gold-foot,' 'sweet-foot,' 'honey-hand,'
  'honey-paw,' 'honey-eater,' but also 'the great,' 'the old,' 'the old
  grandsire<a name="NtA817" href="#Nt817"><sup>[817]</sup></a>.'"
  "Bee-hunter" is then a satisfactory explanation of <i>B&#x113;owulf</i>:
  while the alternative explanations are none of them satisfactory.</p>

  <p>Many scholars have been led off the track by the assumption that Beow
  and Beowulf are to be identified, and that we must therefore assume that
  the first element in Beowulf's name is <i>B&#x113;ow</i>&mdash;that we
  must divide not <i>B&#x113;o-wulf</i> but <i>B&#x113;ow-ulf</i>, "a
  warrior after the manner of Beow<a name="NtA818"
  href="#Nt818"><sup>[818]</sup></a>." But there is no ground <!-- Page 367
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page367"></a>{367}</span>for any such
  assumption. It is true that in ll. 18, 53, "Beowulf" is written where we
  should have expected "Beowa." But, even if two words of similar sound
  have been confused, this fact affords no reason for supposing that they
  must necessarily have been in the first instance connected
  etymologically. And against the "warrior of Beow" interpretation is the
  fact that the name is recorded in the early Northumbrian <i>Liber
  Vitae</i> under the form "Biuuulf<a name="NtA819"
  href="#Nt819"><sup>[819]</sup></a>." This name, which is that of an early
  monk of Durham, is presumably the same as that of the hero of our poem,
  though it does not, of course, follow that the bearer of it was named
  with any special reference to the slayer of Grendel. Now <i>Biuuulf</i>
  is correct Northumbrian for "bee-wolf," but the first element in the word
  cannot stand for <i>B&#x113;ow</i><a name="NtA820"
  href="#Nt820"><sup>[820]</sup></a>, unless the <!-- Page 368 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page368"></a>{368}</span>affinities and forms of
  that word are quite different from all that the evidence has hitherto led
  us to believe. So much at least seems certain. Besides, we have seen that
  Byggvir is taunted by Loki precisely with the fact that he <i>is</i> no
  warrior. If we can estimate the characteristics of the O.E. Beow from
  those of the Scandinavian Byggvir, the name "Warrior after the manner of
  Beow" would be meaningless, if not absurd. Bugge<a name="NtA821"
  href="#Nt821"><sup>[821]</sup></a>, relying upon the parallel O.N. form
  <i>Bjólfr</i><a name="NtA822" href="#Nt822"><sup>[822]</sup></a>, which
  is recorded as the name of one of the early settlers in Iceland<a
  name="NtA823" href="#Nt823"><sup>[823]</sup></a>, tried to interpret the
  word as <i>B&oelig;jólfr</i> "the wolf of the farmstead," quoting as
  parallels <i>Heimulf</i>, <i>Gardulf</i>. But <i>Bjólfr</i> itself is
  best interpreted as "Bee-wolf<a name="NtA824"
  href="#Nt824"><sup>[824]</sup></a>." And admittedly Bugge's explanation
  does not suit the O.E. <i>B&#x113;owulf</i>, and necessitates the
  assumption that the word in English is a mere meaningless borrowing from
  the Scandinavian: for <i>B&#x113;owulf</i> assuredly does not mean "wolf
  of the farmstead<a name="NtA825" href="#Nt825"><sup>[825]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p>Neither can we take very seriously the explanation of Sarrazin and
  Ferguson<a name="NtA826" href="#Nt826"><sup>[826]</sup></a> that
  <i>B&#x113;owulf</i> is an abbreviation of <i>Beadu-wulf</i>, "wolf of
  war." Our business is to interpret the name <i>B&#x113;owulf</i>, or, if
  we cannot, to admit that we cannot; not to substitute some quite distinct
  name for it, and interpret that. Such theories merely show to what
  straits we may be reduced, if we reject the obvious etymology of the
  word.</p>

  <p>And there are two further considerations, which confirm, almost to a
  certainty, this obvious interpretation of "Beowulf" as "Bee-wolf" or
  "Bear." The first is that it agrees excellently with Beowulf's bear-like
  habit of hugging his adversaries to death&mdash;a feature which surely
  belongs to the original kernel of our story, since it is incompatible
  with the chivalrous, <!-- Page 369 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page369"></a>{369}</span>weapon-loving trappings in which that
  story has been dressed<a name="NtA827"
  href="#Nt827"><sup>[827]</sup></a>. The second is that, as I have tried
  to show, the evidence is strongly in favour of Bjarki and Beowulf being
  originally the same figure<a name="NtA828"
  href="#Nt828"><sup>[828]</sup></a>: and Bjarki is certainly a bear-hero<a
  name="NtA829" href="#Nt829"><sup>[829]</sup></a>. His name signifies as
  much, and in the <i>Saga of Rolf Kraki</i> we are told at length how the
  father of Bjarki was a prince who had been turned by enchantment into a
  bear<a name="NtA830" href="#Nt830"><sup>[830]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>If, then, Beowulf is a bear-hero<a name="NtA831"
  href="#Nt831"><sup>[831]</sup></a>, the next step is to enquire whether
  there is any real likeness between his adventures at Heorot and under the
  mere, and the adventures of the hero of the widely-spread "Bear's Son"
  folk-tale. This investigation has, as we have seen above<a name="NtA832"
  href="#Nt832"><sup>[832]</sup></a>, been carried out by Panzer in his
  monumental work, which marks an epoch in the study of <i>Beowulf</i>.</p>

  <p>Panzer's arguments in favour of such connection would, I think, have
  been strengthened if he had either quoted textually a number of the more
  important and less generally accessible folk-tales, or, since this would
  have proved cumbersome, if he had at least given abstracts of them. The
  method which Panzer follows, is to enumerate over two hundred tales, and
  from them to construct a story which is a compound of them all. This is
  obviously a method which is liable to abuse, though I do not say that
  Panzer has abused it. But we must not let a story so constructed usurp in
  our minds the place of the actual recorded folk-tales. Folk-tales, as
  Andrew Lang wrote long ago, "consist of but few incidents, grouped
  together in a kaleidoscopic variety of arrangements." A collection of
  over two hundred cognate tales offers a wide field for the selection
  therefrom of a composite story. Further, some geographical discrimination
  is necessary: these tales are scattered over Europe and Asia, and it is
  important to keep constantly in mind whether a given type of tale
  belongs, for example, to Greece or to Scandinavia.</p>

<p><!-- Page 370 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page370"></a>{370}</span></p>

  <p>A typical example of the Bear's son tale is <i>Der Starke Hans</i> in
  Grimm<a name="NtA833" href="#Nt833"><sup>[833]</sup></a>. Hans is brought
  up in a robber's den: but quite apart from any of the theories we are now
  considering, it has long been recognized that this is a mere toning down
  of the original incredible story, which makes a bear's den the nursery of
  the strong youth<a name="NtA834" href="#Nt834"><sup>[834]</sup></a>. Hans
  overcomes in an empty castle the foe (a mannikin of magic powers) who has
  already worsted his comrades Fir-twister and Stone-splitter. He pursues
  this foe to his hole, is let down by his companions in a basket by a
  rope, slays the foe with his club and rescues a princess. He sends up the
  princess in the basket; but when his own turn comes to be pulled up his
  associates intentionally drop the basket when halfway up. But Hans,
  suspecting treason, has only sent up his club. He escapes by magic help,
  takes vengeance on the traitors, and weds the princess.</p>

  <p>In another story in Grimm<a name="NtA835"
  href="#Nt835"><sup>[835]</sup></a>, the antagonist whom the hero
  overcomes, but does not in this case slay, is called the Earthman, <i>Dat
  Erdmänneken</i>. This type begins with the disappearance of the
  princesses, who are to the orthodox number of three; otherwise it does
  not differ materially from the abstract given above. Grimm records four
  distinct versions, all from Western Germany.</p>

  <p>The versions of this widespread story which are most easily accessible
  to English readers are likely to prejudice such readers against Panzer's
  view. The two versions in Campbell's <i>Popular Tales of the West
  Highlands</i><a name="NtA836" href="#Nt836"><sup>[836]</sup></a>, or the
  version in Kennedy's <i>Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts</i><a
  name="NtA837" href="#Nt837"><sup>[837]</sup></a> are not of a kind to
  remind any unprejudiced reader strongly of <i>Beowulf</i>, or of the
  <i>Grettir</i>-story either. Indeed, I believe that from countries so
  remote as North Italy or Russia parallels can be found which are closer
  than any so far quoted from the Celtic portions of the British Isles.
  Possibly more Celtic parallels may be forthcoming in the future: some
  striking ones at any rate are promised<a name="NtA838"
  href="#Nt838"><sup>[838]</sup></a>.</p>

<p><!-- Page 371 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page371"></a>{371}</span></p>

  <p>So, too, the story of the "Great Bird Dan" (<i>Fugl Dam</i><a
  name="NtA839" href="#Nt839"><sup>[839]</sup></a>), which is accessible to
  English readers in Dasent's translation<a name="NtA840"
  href="#Nt840"><sup>[840]</sup></a>, is one in which the typical features
  have been overlaid by a mass of detail.</p>

  <p>A much more normal specimen of the "Bear's son" story is found, for
  example, in a folk-tale from Lombardy&mdash;the story of <i>Giovanni
  dell' Orso</i><a name="NtA841" href="#Nt841"><sup>[841]</sup></a>.
  Giovanni is brought up in a bear's den, whither his mother has been
  carried off. At five, he has the growth of a man and the strength of a
  giant. At sixteen, he is able to remove the stone from the door of the
  den and escape, with his mother. Going on his adventures with two
  comrades, he comes to an empty palace. The comrades are defeated: it
  becomes the turn of Giovanni to be alone. An old man comes in and "grows,
  grows till his head touched the roof<a name="NtA842"
  href="#Nt842"><sup>[842]</sup></a>." Giovanni mortally wounds the giant,
  who however escapes. They all go in search of him, and find a hole in the
  ground. His comrades let Giovanni down by a rope. He finds a great hall,
  full of rich clothes and provision of every kind: in a second hall he
  finds three girls, each one more beautiful than the other: in a third
  hall he finds the giant himself, drawing up his will<a name="NtA843"
  href="#Nt843"><sup>[843]</sup></a>. Giovanni kills the giant, rescues the
  damsels, and, in spite of his comrades deserting the rope, he escapes,
  pardons them, himself weds the youngest princess and marries his comrades
  to the elder ones.</p>

  <p>I cannot find in this version any mention of the hero smiting the
  giant below with a magic sword which he finds there, as suggested by
  Panzer<a name="NtA844" href="#Nt844"><sup>[844]</sup></a>. But even
  without this, the first part of the story has resemblances to
  <i>Beowulf</i>, and still more to the <i>Grettir</i>-story.</p>

  <p>There are many Slavonic variants. The South Russian story of the
  Norka<a name="NtA845" href="#Nt845"><sup>[845]</sup></a> begins with the
  attack of the Norka upon the King's park. The King offers half his
  kingdom to whomsoever will destroy the beast. The youngest prince of
  three watches, <!-- Page 372 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page372"></a>{372}</span>after the failure of his two elder
  brothers, chases and wounds the monster, who in the end pulls up a stone
  and disappears into the earth. The prince is let down by his brothers,
  and, with the help of a sword specially given him in the underworld, and
  a draught of the water of strength, he slays the foe, and wins the
  princesses. In order to have these for themselves, the elder brothers
  drop what they suppose to be their youngest brother, as they are drawing
  him up: but it is only a stone he has cautiously tied to the rope in
  place of himself. The prince's miraculous return in disguise, his feats,
  recognition by the youngest princess, the exposure of the traitors, and
  marriage of the hero, all follow in due course<a name="NtA846"
  href="#Nt846"><sup>[846]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>A closer Russian parallel is that of <i>Ivashko Medvedko</i><a
  name="NtA847" href="#Nt847"><sup>[847]</sup></a>. "John Honey-eater" or
  "Bear." John grows up, not by years, but by hours: nearly every hour he
  gains an inch in height. At fifteen, there are complaints of his rough
  play with other village boys, and John Bear has to go out into the world,
  after his grandfather has provided him with a weapon, an iron staff of
  immense weight. He meets a champion who is drinking up a river: "Good
  morning, John Bear, whither art going?" "I know not whither; I just go,
  not knowing where to go." "If so, take me with you." The same happens
  with a second champion whose hobby is to carry mountains on his shoulder,
  and with a third, who plucks up oaks or pushes them into the ground. They
  come to a revolving house in a dark forest, which at John's word stands
  with its back door to the forest and its front door to them: all its
  doors and windows open of their own accord. Though the yard is full of
  poultry, the house is empty. Whilst the three companions go hunting, the
  river-swallower stays in the house to cook dinner: this done, he washes
  his head, and sits at the window to comb his locks. Suddenly the earth
  shakes, then stands still: a stone is lifted, and from under it appears
  Baba Yaga driving in her mortar with a pestle: behind her comes barking a
  little dog. A short dialogue ensues, and the champion, at her request,
  gives her food; but the second helping she throws to her dog, and
  thereupon beats the champion with <!-- Page 373 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page373"></a>{373}</span>her pestle till he
  becomes unconscious; then she cuts a strip of skin from his back, and
  after eating all the food, vanishes. The victim recovers his senses, ties
  up his head with a handkerchief, and, when his companions return,
  apologizes for the ill-success of his cooking: "He had been nearly
  suffocated by the fumes of the charcoal, and had had his work cut out to
  get the room clear." Exactly the same happens to the other champions. On
  the fourth day it is the turn of John Bear, and here again the same
  formulas are repeated. John does the cooking, washes his head, sits down
  at the window and begins to comb his curly locks. Baba Yaga appears with
  the usual phenomena, and the usual dialogue follows, till she begins to
  belabour the hero with her pestle. But he wrests it from her, beats her
  almost to death, cuts three strips from her skin, and imprisons her in a
  closet. When his companions return, they are astonished to find dinner
  ready. After dinner they have a bath, and the companions try not to show
  their mutilated backs, but at last have to confess. "Now I see why you
  all suffered from suffocation," says John Bear. He goes to the closet,
  takes the three strips cut from his friends, and reinserts them: they
  heal at once. Then he ties up Baba Yaga by a cord fastened to one foot,
  and they all shoot at the cord in turn. John Bear hits it, and cuts the
  string in two; Baba Yaga falls to the earth, but rises, runs to the stone
  from under which she had appeared, lifts it, and vanishes. Each of the
  companions tries in turn to lift the stone, but only John can accomplish
  it, and only he is willing to go down. His comrades let him down by a
  rope, which however is too short, and John has to eke it out by the three
  strips previously cut from the back of Baba Yaga. At the bottom he sees a
  path, follows it, and reaches a palace where are three beautiful maidens,
  who welcome him, but warn him against their mother, who is Baba Yaga
  herself: "She is asleep now, but she keeps at her head a sword. Do not
  touch it, but take two golden apples lying on a silver tray, wake her
  gently, and offer them to her. As soon as she begins to eat, seize the
  sword, and cut her head off at one blow." John Bear carries out these
  instructions, and sends up the maidens, two to be wives to his
  companions, and the youngest to be his own wife. This leaves the third
  companion wifeless <!-- Page 374 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page374"></a>{374}</span>and, in indignation, he cuts the rope when
  the turn comes to pull John up. The hero falls and is badly hurt. [John
  has forgotten, in this version, to put his iron club into the basket
  instead of himself&mdash;indeed he has up to now made no use of his
  staff.] In time the hero sees an underground passage, and makes his way
  out into the white world. Here he finds the youngest maiden, who is
  tending cattle, after refusing to marry the false companion. John Bear
  follows her home, slays his former comrades with his staff, and throws
  their bodies on the field for the wild beasts to devour. He then takes
  his sweetheart home to his people, and weds her.</p>

  <p>The abstract given above is from a translation made by one of my
  students, Miss M. Steine, who tells me that she had heard the tale in
  this form many times from her old nurse "when we were being sent to
  sleep, or sitting round her in the evening." I have given it at this
  length because I do not know of any accessible translation into any
  Western language.</p>

  <p>Panzer enumerates two hundred and two variants of the story: and there
  are others<a name="NtA848" href="#Nt848"><sup>[848]</sup></a>. But there
  is reason in the criticism that what is important for us is the form the
  folk-tale may have taken in those countries where we must look for the
  original home of the <i>Beowulf</i>-story<a name="NtA849"
  href="#Nt849"><sup>[849]</sup></a>. The Mantuan folk-tale may have been
  carried down to North Italy from Scandinavia by the Longobards: who can
  say? But Panzer's theory must stand or fall by the parallels which can be
  drawn between the <i>Beowulf-Grettir</i>-story on the one hand, and the
  folk-tales as they have been collected in the countries where this story
  is native: the lands, that is to say, adjoining the North Sea.</p>

  <p>Now it is precisely here that we do find the most remarkable
  resemblances: in Iceland, the Faroes, Norway, Denmark, Jutland,
  Schleswig, and the Low German lands as far as the Scheldt.</p>

  <p>An Icelandic version exists in an unprinted MS at Reykjavik<a
  name="NtA850" href="#Nt850"><sup>[850]</sup></a> which can be consulted
  in a German translation<a name="NtA851"
  href="#Nt851"><sup>[851]</sup></a>. In this <!-- Page 375 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page375"></a>{375}</span>version a bear, who is
  really an enchanted prince, carries off a princess. He resumes his human
  form and weds the princess, but must still at times take the bear's form.
  His child, the Bear-boy (Bjarndreingur), is to be kept in the house
  during the long periods when the enchanted husband is away. But at twelve
  years old the Bear-boy is too strong and unmanageable, bursts out, and
  slays a bear who turns out to be his father. His mother's heart is
  broken, but Bear-boy goes on his adventures, and associates with himself
  three companions, one of whom is Stein. They build a house in the wood,
  which is attacked by a giant, and, as usual, the companions are unable to
  withstand the attacks. Bear-boy does so, ties the giant's hands behind
  his back, and fastens him by his beard. But the giant tears himself free.
  As in <i>Beowulf</i>, Bear-boy and his companions follow the track by the
  drops of blood, and come to a hole. Stein is let some way down, the other
  companions further, but only Bear-boy dares to go to the bottom. There he
  finds a weeping princess, and learns that she, and her two sisters, have
  been carried off by three giants, one of whom is his former assailant. He
  slays all three, and sends their heads up, together with the maidens and
  other treasures. But his companions desert the rope, and he has to climb
  up unaided. In the end he weds the youngest princess.</p>

  <p>The story from the Faroe Islands runs thus:</p>

  <p>Three brothers lived together and took turns, two to go out fishing,
  and one to be at home. For two days, when the two elder brothers were at
  home, came a giant with a long beard (Skeggjatussi) and ate and drank all
  the food. Then comes the turn of the despised youngest brother, who is
  called in one version Øskudólgur&mdash;"the one who sits and rakes in the
  ashes"&mdash;a kind of male Cinderella. This brother routs the giant,
  either by catching his long beard in a cleft tree-trunk, or by branding
  him in the nose with a hot iron. In either case the mutilated giant
  escapes down a hole: in one version, after the other brothers come home,
  they follow him to this hole by the track of his blood. The two elder
  brothers leave the task of plunging down to the youngest one, who finds
  below a girl (in the second version, two kidnapped princesses). He finds
  also a magic sword hanging <!-- Page 376 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page376"></a>{376}</span>on the wall, which he is only able to lift
  when he has drunk a magic potion. He then slays the giant, rescues the
  maiden or maidens, is betrayed in the usual way by his brothers: in the
  one version they deliberately refuse to draw him up: in the other they
  cut the rope as they are doing so: but he is discreetly sending up only a
  big stone. The hero is helped out, however, by a giant, "Skræddi Kjálki"
  or "Snerkti risi," and in the end marries the princess<a name="NtA852"
  href="#Nt852"><sup>[852]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>In the Norwegian folk-tale the three adventurers are called
  respectively the Captain, the Lieutenant and the Soldier. They search for
  the three princesses, and watch in a castle, where the Captain and
  Lieutenant are in turn worsted by a strange visitor&mdash;who in this
  version is not identical with the troll below ground who guards the
  princesses<a name="NtA853" href="#Nt853"><sup>[853]</sup></a>. When the
  turn of the Soldier comes, he seizes the intruder (the man, as he is
  called).</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Ah no, Ah no, spare my life," said the man, "and you shall know all.
  East of the castle is a great sandheap, and down in it a winch, with
  which you can lower yourself. But if you are afraid, and do not dare to
  go right down, you only need to pull the bell rope which you will find
  there, and up you will come again. But if you dare venture so far as to
  come to the bottom, there stands a flask on a shelf over the door: you
  must drink what is in it: so will you become so strong that you can
  strike the head off the troll of the mountain. And by the door there
  hangs a Troll-sword, which also you must take, for no other steel will
  bite on his body."</p>

  <p>When he had learnt this, he let the man go. When the Captain and the
  Lieutenant came home, they were not a little surprised to find the
  Soldier alive. "How have you escaped a drubbing," said they, "has not the
  man been <!-- Page 377 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page377"></a>{377}</span>here?" "Oh yes, he is quite a good fellow,
  he is," said the Soldier, "I have learnt from him where the princesses
  are," and he told them all. They were glad when they heard that, and when
  they had eaten, they went all three to the sandheap.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>As usual, the Captain and the Lieutenant do not dare to go to the
  bottom: the hero accomplishes the adventure, is (as usual) betrayed by
  his comrades, but is saved because he has put a stone in the basket
  instead of himself, and in the end is rescued by the interposition of
  "Kløverhans."</p>

  <p>What is the explanation of the "sandheap" (<i>sandhaug</i>) I do not
  know. But one cannot forget that Grettir's adventure in the house,
  followed by his adventure with the troll under the earth, is localized at
  Sandhaugar. This may be a mere accident; but it is worth noting that in
  following up the track indicated by Panzer we come across startling
  coincidences of this kind. As stated above, it can hardly be due to any
  influence of the <i>Grettis Saga</i> upon the folk-tale<a name="NtA854"
  href="#Nt854"><sup>[854]</sup></a>. The likeness between the two is too
  remote to have suggested a transference of such details from the one
  story to the other.</p>

  <p>We find the story in its normal form in Jutland<a name="NtA855"
  href="#Nt855"><sup>[855]</sup></a>. The hero, a foundling, is named
  Bjørnøre (Bear-ears). There is no explanation offered of this name, but
  we know that in other versions of the story, where the hero is half bear
  and half man, his bear nature is shown by his bear's ears. "Bear-ears"
  comes with his companions to an empty house, worsts the foe (the old man,
  <i>den gamle</i>) who has put his companions to shame, and fixes him by
  his beard in a cloven tree. The foe escapes nevertheless; they follow him
  to his hole: the companions are afraid, but "Bear-ears" is let down,
  finds the enemy on his bed, and slays him. The rest of the story follows
  the usual pattern. "Bear-ears" rescues and sends up the princesses, his
  comrades detach the rope, which however is hauling up only the hero's
  iron club. He escapes miraculously from his confinement below, and
  returns to marry the youngest princess. In another Danish version, from
  the South of Zealand<a name="NtA856" href="#Nt856"><sup>[856]</sup></a>,
  the hero, "Strong Hans" (nothing is said <!-- Page 378 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page378"></a>{378}</span>about his bear-origin),
  comes with his companions to a magnificent but empty castle. The old
  witch worsts his comrades and imprisons them under the trap-door: but
  Hans beats her and rescues them, though the witch herself escapes. Hans
  is let down, rescues the princesses, is betrayed by his comrades (who,
  thinking to drop him in drawing him up, only drop his iron club), and
  finally weds the third princess.</p>

  <p>A little further South we have three versions of the same tale
  recorded for Schleswig-Holstein<a name="NtA857"
  href="#Nt857"><sup>[857]</sup></a>. The hero wins his victory below by
  means of "a great iron sword" (<i>en grotes ysernes Schwäert</i>) which
  he can only wield after drinking of the magic potion.</p>

  <p>From Hanover comes the story of Peter Bär<a name="NtA858"
  href="#Nt858"><sup>[858]</sup></a>, which shows all the familiar
  features: from the same district came some of Grimm's variants. Others
  were from the Rhine provinces: but the fullest version of all comes from
  the Scheldt, just over the Flemish border. The hero, Jean l'Ourson, is
  recovered as a child from a bear's den, is despised in his youth<a
  name="NtA859" href="#Nt859"><sup>[859]</sup></a>, but gives early proof
  of his strength. He defends an empty castle <i>un superbe château</i>,
  when his companion has failed, strikes off an arm<a name="NtA860"
  href="#Nt860"><sup>[860]</sup></a> of his assailant
  <i>Petit-Père-Bidoux</i>, chases him to his hole, <i>un puits vaste et
  profond</i>. He is let down by his companion, but finding the rope too
  short, plunges, and arrives battered at the bottom. There he perceives
  <i>une lumière qui brillait au bout d'une longue galerie</i><a
  name="NtA861" href="#Nt861"><sup>[861]</sup></a>. At the end of the
  gallery he sees his former assailant, attended by <i>une vieille femme à
  cheveux blancs, qui semblait âgée de plus de cent ans</i>, who is salving
  his wounded arm. The hero quenches the light (which is a magic one)
  smites his foe on the head and kills him, and then rekindles the lamp<a
  name="NtA862" href="#Nt862"><sup>[862]</sup></a>. His companion above
  seeks to rob him of the two princesses he has won, by detaching the rope.
  Nevertheless, he escapes, weds the good princess, and punishes his
  faithless companion by making him wed the bad one.</p>

  <p>The white-haired old woman is not spoken of as the mother <!-- Page
  379 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page379"></a>{379}</span>of the foe
  she is nursing, and it may be doubted whether she is in any way parallel
  to Grendel's mother. The hero does not fight her: indeed it is she who,
  in the end, enables him to escape. Still the parallels between Jean
  l'Ourson and Beowulf are striking enough. Nine distinct features recur,
  in the same order, in the <i>Beowulf</i>-story and in this folk-tale. It
  needs a more robust faith than I possess to attribute this solely to
  chance.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, this French-Flemish tale is found in a somewhat
  sophisticated collection. Its recorder, as Sainte-Beuve points out in his
  letter introductory to the series<a name="NtA863"
  href="#Nt863"><sup>[863]</sup></a>, uses literary touches which diminish
  the value of his folk-tales to the student of origins. Any contamination
  from the <i>Beowulf</i>-story or the <i>Grettir</i>-story is surely
  improbable enough in this case: nevertheless, one would have liked the
  tale taken down verbatim from the lips of some simple-minded narrator as
  it used to be told at Condé on the Scheldt.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>But if we take together the different versions enumerated above, the
  result is, I think, convincing. Here are eight versions of one folk-tale
  taken as representatives from a much larger number current in the
  countries in touch with the North Sea: from Iceland, the Faroes, Norway,
  Jutland, Zealand, Schleswig, Hanover, and the Scheldt. The champion is a
  bear-hero (as Beowulf almost certainly is, and as Bjarki quite certainly
  is); he is called, in Iceland, <i>Bjarndreingur</i>, in Jutland,
  <i>Bjørnøre</i>, in Hanover, <i>Peter Bär</i>, on the Scheldt <i>Jean
  l'Ourson</i>. Like Beowulf, he is despised in his youth (Faroe, Scheldt).
  In all versions he resists his adversary in an empty house or castle,
  after his comrades have failed. In most versions of the folk-tale this is
  the third attack, as it is in the case of Grettir at Sandhaugar and of
  Bjarki: in <i>Beowulf</i>, on the contrary, we gather that Heorot has
  been raided many times. The adversary, though vanquished, escapes; in one
  version after the loss of an arm (Scheldt): they follow his track to the
  hole into which he has vanished, sometimes, as in <i>Beowulf</i>, marking
  traces of his blood (Iceland, Faroe, Schleswig). The hero always ventures
  down alone, and gets into <!-- Page 380 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page380"></a>{380}</span>an underworld of magic, which has left
  traces of its mysteriousness in <i>Beowulf</i>. In one tale (Scheldt) the
  hero sees a magic lamp burning below, just as he sees the fire in
  <i>Beowulf</i> or the <i>Grettis Saga</i>. He overcomes either his
  original foe, or new ones, often by the use of a magic sword (Faroe,
  Norway, Schleswig); this sword hangs by the door (Norway) or on the wall
  (Faroe) as in <i>Beowulf</i>. After slaying his foe, the hero rekindles
  the magic lamp, in the Scheldt fairy tale, just as he kindles a light in
  the <i>Grettis Saga</i>, and as the light flashes up in <i>Beowulf</i>
  after the hero has smitten Grendel's mother. The hero is in each case
  deserted by his companions: a feature which, while it is marked in the
  <i>Grettis Saga</i>, can obviously be allowed to survive in
  <i>Beowulf</i> only in a much softened form. The chosen retainers whom
  Beowulf has taken with him on his journey could not be represented as
  unfaithful, because the poet is reserving the episode of the faithless
  retainers for the death of Beowulf. To have twice represented the escort
  as cowardly would have made the poem a satire upon the <i>comitatus</i>,
  and would have assured it a hostile reception in every hall from
  Canterbury to Edinburgh. But there is no doubt as to the faithlessness of
  the comrade Stein in the <i>Grettis Saga</i>. And in Zealand, one of the
  faithless companions is called <i>Stenhuggeren</i> (the Stone-hewer), in
  Schleswig <i>Steenklöwer</i>, in Hanover <i>Steinspieler</i>, whilst in
  Iceland he has the same name, <i>Stein</i>, which he has in the
  <i>Grettis Saga</i>.</p>

  <p>The fact that the departure home of the Danes in <i>Beowulf</i> is due
  to the same cause as that which accounts for the betrayal of his trust by
  Stein, shows that in the original <i>Beowulf</i>-story also this feature
  must have occurred, however much it may have become worn down in the
  existing epic.</p>

  <p>I think enough has been said to show that there is a real likeness
  between a large number of recorded folk-tales and the
  <i>Beowulf-Grettir</i> story. The parallel is not merely with an
  artificial, theoretical composite put together by Panzer. But it becomes
  equally clear that <i>Beowulf</i> cannot be spoken of as a version of
  these folk-tales. At most it is a version of a portion of them. The
  omission of the princesses in <i>Beowulf</i> and the <i>Grettis Saga</i>
  is fundamental. With the princesses much else falls away. There is no
  longer any motive for the betrayal of trust <!-- Page 381 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page381"></a>{381}</span>by the watchers. The
  disguise of the hero and his vengeance are now no longer necessary to the
  tale.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>It might be argued that there was something about the three princesses
  which made them unsatisfactory as subjects of story. It has been thought
  that in the oldest version the hero married all three: an awkward episode
  where a <i>scop</i> had to compose a poem for an audience certainly
  monogamous and most probably Christian. The rather tragic and sombre
  atmosphere of the stories of Beowulf and Grettir fits in better with a
  version from which the princesses, and the living happily ever
  afterwards, have been dropped. On the other hand, it might be argued that
  the folk-tale is composite, and that the source from which the
  <i>Beowulf-Grettir</i>-story drew was a simpler tale to which the
  princesses had not yet been added.</p>

  <p>And there are additions as well as subtractions. Alike in
  <i>Beowulf</i> and in the <i>Grettis Saga</i>, the fight in the house and
  the fight below are associated with struggles with monsters of different
  sex. The association of "The Devil and his Dam" has only few and remote
  parallels in the "Bear's-son" folk-tale.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>But Panzer has, I think, proved that the struggle of Beowulf in the
  hall, and his plunging down into the deep, is simply an epic
  glorification of a folk-tale motive.</p>

<p class="cenhead">I. THE DATE OF THE DEATH OF HYGELAC.</p>

  <p>Gregory of Tours mentions the defeat of Chochilaicus (Hygelac) as an
  event of the reign of Theudoric. Now Theudoric succeeded his father
  Chlodoweg, who died 27 Nov. 511. Theudoric died in 534. This, then, gives
  the extreme limits of time; but as Gregory mentions the event among the
  first occurrences of the reign, the period 512-520 has generally been
  suggested, or in round numbers about 515 or 516.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, we cannot attach much importance to the mere order
  followed by Gregory<a name="NtA864" href="#Nt864"><sup>[864]</sup></a>.
  He may well have had no means of dating the event exactly. Of much more
  importance than the order, is the fact he records, that Theudoric did not
  <!-- Page 382 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page382"></a>{382}</span>defeat Chochilaicus in person, but sent
  his son Theudobert to repel the invaders.</p>

  <p>Now Theudobert was born before the death of his grandfather Chlodoweg.
  For Gregory tells us that Chlodoweg left not only four sons, but a
  grandson Theudobert, <i>elegantem atque utilem</i><a name="NtA865"
  href="#Nt865"><sup>[865]</sup></a>: <i>utilem</i> cannot mean that, at
  the time of the death of Chlodoweg, Theudobert was of age to conduct
  affairs of state, for Chlodoweg was only 45 at death<a name="NtA866"
  href="#Nt866"><sup>[866]</sup></a>. The Merovingians were a precocious
  race; but if we are to allow Theudobert to have been at least fifteen
  before being placed in charge of a very important expedition, and
  Chlodoweg to have been at least forty before becoming a grandfather, the
  defeat of Hygelac cannot be put before 521; and probability would favour
  a date five or ten years later.</p>

  <p>There is confirmation for this. When Theudobert died, in 548, he left
  one son only, quite a child and still under tutelage<a name="NtA867"
  href="#Nt867"><sup>[867]</sup></a>; probably therefore not more than
  twelve or thirteen at most. We know the circumstances of the child's
  birth. Theudobert had been betrothed by his father Theudoric to a
  Longobardic princess, Wisigardis<a name="NtA868"
  href="#Nt868"><sup>[868]</sup></a>. In the meantime he fell in love with
  the lady Deoteria<a name="NtA869" href="#Nt869"><sup>[869]</sup></a>, and
  married her<a name="NtA870" href="#Nt870"><sup>[870]</sup></a>. The
  Franks were shocked at this fickleness (<i>valde scandalizabantur</i>),
  and Theudobert had ultimately to put away Deoteria<a name="NtA871"
  href="#Nt871"><sup>[871]</sup></a>, although they had this young son
  (<i>parvulum filium</i>), who, as we have seen, could hardly have been
  born before 535, and possibly was born years later. Theudobert then
  married the Longobardic princess, in the seventh year after their
  betrothal. So it cannot have been much before 530 that Theudobert's
  father was first arranging the Longobardic match. A king is not likely to
  have waited to find a wife for a son, upon whom his dynasty was to
  depend, till fifteen years after that son was of age to win a memorable
  victory<a name="NtA872" href="#Nt872"><sup>[872]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>I remember it was with extreme difficulty that I could bring my master

  that controversies, wranglings, disputes, and positiveness in false or

  <p>Books dealing with other subjects, but illustrating <i>Beowulf</i>,
  present a difficulty. Such books may have a value for <i>Beowulf</i>
  students, even though the author may never refer to our poem, and have
  occasionally been included in previous bibliographies. But, unless
  <i>Beowulf</i> is closely concerned, these books are not usually
  mentioned below: such enumeration, if carried out consistently, would
  clog a bibliography already all too bulky. Thus, Siecke's
  <i>Drachenkämpfe</i> does not seem to come within the scope of this
  bibliography, because the author is not concerned with Beowulf's
  dragon.</p>

  <p>Obviously every general discussion of Old English metre must concern
  itself largely with <i>Beowulf</i>: for such treatises the student is
  referred to the section <i>Metrik</i> of Brandl's Bibliography (<i>Pauls
  Grdr.</i>); and, for Old English heroic legend in general, to the
  Bibliography of my edition of <i>Widsith</i>.</p>

  <p>Many scholars, e.g. Heinzel, have put into their reviews of the books
  of others, much original work which might well have formed the material
  for independent articles. Such reviews are noted as "weighty," but it
  must not be supposed that the reviews not so marked are negligible;
  unless of some value to scholarship, reviews are not usually mentioned
  below.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><a name="Bib3">§ 3</a>. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS</p>

  <p><i>Beowulf</i> fills ff. 129 (132)<i>a</i> to 198 (201)<i>b</i> of the
  British Museum <span class="scac">MS</span> <i>Cotton Vitellius A.
  XV.</i></p>

  <p><i>Beowulf</i> is written in two hands, the first of which goes to l.
  1939. This hand was identified by Prof. Sedgefield (<i>Beowulf</i>,
  <i>Introduction</i>, p. xiv, footnote) with that of the piece immediately
  preceding <i>Beowulf</i> in the <span class="scac">MS</span>, and by Mr
  Kenneth Sisam, in 1916, with that of all three immediately preceding
  pieces: the <i>Christopher</i> fragment, the <i>Wonders of the East</i>,
  and the <i>Letter of Alexander on the Wonders of India</i>. The pieces
  preceding these, however (the <i>Soliloquies of S. Augustine</i>, the
  <i>Gospel of Nicodemus</i>, <i>Salomon and Saturn</i>), are certainly not
  in the same hand, and their connection with the <i>Beowulf</i>-<span
  class="scac">MS</span> is simply due to the bookbinder.</p>

  <p>From l. 1939 to the end, <i>Beowulf</i> is written in a second hand,
  thicker and less elegant than the first. This second hand seems to be
  clearly identical with that in which the poem of <i>Judith</i>,
  immediately following <i>Beowulf</i>, is written. This was pointed out by
  Sievers in 1872 (<i>Z.f.d.A.</i> <span class="scac">XV</span>, 457), and
  has never, I think, been disputed (cf. Sisam, p. 337; Förster, p. 31).
  Nevertheless the two poems have probably not always formed one book. For
  the last page of <i>Beowulf</i> was apparently once the last page of the
  volume, to judge from its battered condition, whilst <i>Judith</i> is
  imperfect at the beginning. And there are trifling differences, e.g. in
  the frequency of the use of contractions, and the form of the capital
  H.</p>

  <p>This identity of the scribe of the second portion of <i>Beowulf</i>
  and the <i>Judith</i> scribe, together with the identity (pointed out by
  Mr Sisam) of the scribe of the first portion of <i>Beowulf</i> and the
  scribe of the three preceding works, is important. A detailed comparison
  of these texts will throw light upon the characteristics of the
  scribes.</p>

  <p>That the three preceding works are in the same hand as that of the
  first <i>Beowulf</i> scribe was again announced, independently of Mr
  Sisam, by Prof. Max Förster, in 1919. Sievers had already in 1871 arrived
  at the same result (see Förster, p. 35, note) but had not published
  it.</p>

  <p>It seems to me in the highest degree improbable that the
  <i>Beowulf</i>-<span class="scac">MS</span> has lost its ending, as Prof.
  Förster thinks (pp. 82, 88). Surely nothing could be better than the
  conclusion of the poem as it stands in the <span class="scac">MS</span>:
  that the <!-- Page 386 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page386"></a>{386}</span>casual loss of a number of leaves could
  have resulted in so satisfactory a conclusion is, I think, not
  conceivable. Moreover, the scribe has crammed as much material as
  possible into the last leaf of <i>Beowulf</i>, making his lines
  abnormally long, and using contractions in a way he does not use them
  elsewhere. The only reason for this must be to avoid running over into a
  new leaf or quire: there could be no motive for this crowded page if the
  poem had ever run on beyond it.</p>

  <p>There is pretty general agreement that the date of the
  <i>Beowulf</i>-<span class="scac">MS</span> is about the year 1000, and
  that it is somewhat more likely to be before that date than after.</p>

  <p>The <i>Beowulf</i>-<span class="scac">MS</span> was injured in the
  great Cottonian fire of 1731, and the edges of the parchment have since
  chipped away owing to the damage then sustained. Valuable assistance can
  therefore be derived from the two transcripts now preserved in the Royal
  Library of Copenhagen, made in 1787, when the <span
  class="scac">MS</span> was much less damaged.</p>

  <p>The first description of the <i>Beowulf</i>-<span

  (<i>Librorum Septentrionalium ... Catalogus</i>, pp. 218&mdash;19,
  Oxoniæ, forming vol. <span class="scac">II</span> of Hickes'
  <i>Thesaurus</i>). Two short extracts from the <span
  class="scac">MS</span> are given by Wanley. He describes the poem as
  telling of the wars <i>quæ Beowulfus quidam Danus, ex regio Scyldingorum
  stirpe ortus, gessit contra Sueciæ regulos</i>. The text was printed by
  <span class="sc">Thorkelin</span> in 1815, and the <span
  class="scac">MS</span> was collated by <span class="sc">Conybeare</span>,
  who in his <i>Illustrations</i> (1826) issued 19 pages of corrections of
  Thorkelin. These corrections were further corrected by <span
  class="sc">J. M. Kemble</span> in 1837 (Letter to M. Francisque Michel,
  in Michel's <i>Bibliothèque Anglo-Saxonne</i>, pp. 20, 51-8). Meantime
  Kemble's text had been issued in 1833, based upon his examination of the
  <span class="scac">MS</span>. The <span class="scac">MS</span> was also
  seen by <span class="sc">Thorpe</span> (in 1830: Thorpe's text was not
  published till 1855) and by <span class="sc">Grundtvig</span> (pub.
  1861). A further collation was that of <span class="sc">E. Kölbing</span>
  in 1876 (Zur Beóvulf-handschrift, <i>Archiv</i>, <span
  class="scac">LVI</span>, 91-118). Kölbing's collation proves the
  superiority of Kemble's text to Grundtvig's. Line for line transcripts of

  poem, because a leaf had been misplaced in the <span
  class="scac">MS</span>, so that the account of the fighting between
  Grendel and Beowulf (ll. 740-82) occurred immediately after l. 91. The
  struggle between Beowulf and an (unnamed) adversary being thus made to
  follow the account of Hrothgar's court at Heorot, Turner was led to
  suppose that the poem narrated the attempt of Beowulf to avenge <i>on
  Hrothgar</i> the feud for a homicide he had committed. "The transition,"
  Turner not unreasonably complains, "is rather violent." The correct

  <p>No attempt is made here to deal with Old English heroic legend in
  general: nor to enumerate the references to <i>Beowulf</i> in histories
  of literature. Probably the earliest allusion to our poem by a great
  writer is in Scott's <i>Essay on Romance</i> (1824):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Saxons had, no doubt, Romances, ... and Mr Turner ... has given

  sleep in an ill-ventilated hall in a state of intoxication, but to which
  Beowulf, whose health has been confirmed by a recent sea-voyage, is not
  liable. This view is not as new as its author believes it to be, and a
  letter from von Holstein Rathlau is added, pointing this out. It might
  further have been pointed out that as early as 1879 Grendel was explained
  as the malaria. Cf. the theories of Laistner, Kögel and Golther, and see

<h3>NOTES</h3>

<div class="note">
  <p><a name="Nt1" href="#NtA1">[1]</a> The exact equivalent to
  <i>Hr&#x14D;ðgar</i> is found in O.N., in the form <i>Hróðgeirr</i>. The
  by-form <i>Hróarr</i>, which is used of the famous Danish king, is due to
  a number of rather irregular changes, which can however be paralleled.
  The Primitive Germanic form of the name would have been
  *<i>Hr&#x14D;þugaisaz</i>: for the loss of the <i>g</i> at the beginning
  of the second element we may compare <i>Aðils</i> with
  <i>&#x112;adgils</i> (Noreen, <i>Altisländische Grammatik</i>, 1903, §
  223); for the loss of <i>ð</i> before <i>w</i> compare <i>Hrólfr</i> with
  <i>Hr&#x14D;ðwulf</i> (Noreen, § 222); for the absence of <i>R-</i>
  umlaut in the second syllable, combined with loss of the <i>g</i>,
  compare O.N. <i>nafarr</i> with O.E. <i>nafug&#x101;r</i> (Noreen, §
  69).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt2" href="#NtA2">[2]</a> Corresponding to O.N. <i>Aðils</i>
  we should expect O.E. <i>Æðgils</i>, <i>Æðgisl</i>. The form
  <i>&#x112;adgils</i> may be due to confusion with the famous Eadgils,
  king of the Myrgingas, who is mentioned in <i>Widsith</i>. The name comes
  only once in <i>Beowulf</i> (l. 2392) and may owe its form there to a
  corruption of the scribe. That the O.E. form is corrupt seems more likely
  than that the O.N. <i>Aðils</i>, so well known and so frequently
  recorded, is a corruption of <i>Auðgisl</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt3" href="#NtA3">[3]</a> It must be remembered that the
  sound changes of the Germanic dialects have been worked out so minutely
  that it is nearly always possible to decide quite definitely whether two
  names do or do not exactly correspond. Only occasionally is dispute
  possible [e.g. whether <i>Hrothgar</i> is or is not phonetically the
  exact equivalent of <i>Hroarr</i>].</p>

  <p><a name="Nt4" href="#NtA4">[4]</a> See below, pp. 8-10.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt5" href="#NtA5">[5]</a> <i>Chochilaicus</i>, which appears
  to be the correct form, corresponds to <i>Hygelac</i> (in the primitive
  form <i>Hugilaikaz</i>) as <i>Chlodovechus</i> to <i>Hludovicus</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt6" href="#NtA6">[6]</a> The passages in <i>Beowulf</i>
  referring to this expedition are:</p>

  <p>1202 <i>etc.</i>. Frisians (adjoining the Hetware) and Franks
  mentioned as the foes.</p>

  <p>2354 <i>etc.</i> Hetware mentioned.</p>

  <p>2501 <i>etc.</i> Hugas (= Franks) and the Frisian king mentioned.</p>

  <p>2914 <i>etc.</i> Franks, Frisians, Hugas, Hetware and "the
  Merovingian" mentioned.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt7" href="#NtA7">[7]</a> The identification of Chochilaicus
  with Hygelac is the most important discovery ever made in the study of
  <i>Beowulf</i>, and the foundation of our belief in the historic
  character of its episodes. It is sometimes attributed to Grundtvig,
  sometimes to Outzen. It was first vaguely suggested by Grundtvig
  (<i>Nyeste Skilderie af Kjøbenhavn</i>, 1815, col. 1030): the importance
  of the identification was worked out by him fully, two years later
  (<i>Danne-Virke</i>, <span class="scac">II</span>, 285). In the meantime
  the passage from Gregory had been quoted by Outzen in his review of
  Thorkelin's <i>Beowulf</i> (<i>Kieler Blätter</i>, <span
  class="sc">iii</span>, 312). Outzen's reference was obviously made
  independently, but he failed to detect the real bearing of the passage
  upon <i>Beowulf</i>. Credit for the find accordingly belongs solely to
  Grundtvig.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt8" href="#NtA8">[8]</a> Ongentheow is mentioned in
  <i>Widsith</i> (l. 31) as a famous king of the Swedes. Many of the kings
  mentioned in the same list can be proved to be historical, and the
  reference in <i>Widsith</i> therefore supports Ongentheow's historic
  character, but is far, in itself, from proving it.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt9" href="#NtA9">[9]</a> Strictly <i>Anganþér</i>. See
  Heusler, <i>Heldennamen in mehrfacher Lautgestalt, Z.f.d.A.</i> <span
  class="scac">LII</span>, 101.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt10" href="#NtA10">[10]</a> ll. 2382-4.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt11" href="#NtA11">[11]</a> ll. 2612-9.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt12" href="#NtA12">[12]</a> Whether it be accuracy or
  accident, these names Ottar and Athils come just at that place in the
  list of the <i>Ynglinga tal</i> which, when we reckon back the
  generations, we find to correspond to the beginning of the sixth century.
  And this is the date when we know from <i>Beowulf</i> that they should
  have been reigning.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt13" href="#NtA13">[13]</a> But the accounts are quite
  inconsistent. Saxo (ed. Holder, pp. 56-7) implies a version in which
  Athils was deposed, if not slain, by Bothvar Bjarki, which is quite at
  variance with other information given by Saxo.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt14" href="#NtA14">[14]</a> Unless they are among the
  fragments carried off to the Stockholm Museum. Little of interest was
  found in these mounds when they were opened: everything had been too
  thoroughly burnt.</p>

  Swedish&mdash;Ongentheow, Onela, Ohthere, Eanmund, Eadgils: the
  Geatic&mdash;Hrethel, Herebeald, Hætheyn, Hygelac, Heardred. The same
  principle is strongly marked in the Old English pedigrees.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt20" href="#NtA20">[20]</a> As is done, e.g., by Schück
  (<i>Studier i Beowulf-sagan</i>, 27).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt21" href="#NtA21">[21]</a> "Dragon fights are more
  frequent, not less frequent, the nearer we come to historic times":
  Olrik, <i>Heltedigtning</i>, <span class="scac">I</span>, 313. The dragon
  survived much later in Europe than has been generally recognized. He was
  flying from Mount Pilatus in 1649. (See J. J. Scheuchzer, <i>Itinera per
  Helvetiae Alpinas regiones</i>, 1723, <span class="scac">III</span>, p.
  385.) The same authority quotes accounts of dragons authenticated by
  priests, his own contemporaries, and supplies many bloodcurdling
  engravings of the same.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt22" href="#NtA22">[22]</a> Cf. on this point Klaeber in
  <i>Anglia</i>, <span class="scac">XXXVI</span> (1912) p. 190.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt23" href="#NtA23">[23]</a> l. 2382.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt24" href="#NtA24">[24]</a> l. 2393.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt25" href="#NtA25">[25]</a> Of course, even if Beowulf's
  reign over the Geatas is not historic, this does not exclude the
  possibility of his having <i>some</i> historic foundation.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt26" href="#NtA26">[26]</a> Attempts at working out the
  chronology of <i>Beowulf</i> have been made by Gering (in his
  translation) and by Heusler (<i>Archiv</i>, <span
  class="scac">CXXIV</span>, 9-14). On the whole the chronology of
  <i>Beowulf</i> is self-consistent, but there are one or two discrepancies
  which do not admit of solution.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt27" href="#NtA27">[27]</a> l. 468.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt28" href="#NtA28">[28]</a> l. 2161.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt29" href="#NtA29">[29]</a> <i>Widsith</i>, l. 46.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt30" href="#NtA30">[30]</a> <i>Beowulf</i>, l. 2160. Had
  Hrothulf been a son of Heorogar he could not have been passed over in
  silence here. Neither can Hrothulf be Hrothgar's sister's son: for since
  the sister married the Swedish king, Hrothulf would in that case be a
  Swedish prince, and presumably would be living at the Swedish court, and
  bearing a name connected by alliteration with those of the Swedish, not
  the Danish house. Besides, had he been a Swedish prince, he must have
  been heard of in connection with the dynastic quarrels of the Swedish
  house.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt31" href="#NtA31">[31]</a> ll. 1163-5.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt32" href="#NtA32">[32]</a> ll. 1188-91.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt33" href="#NtA33">[33]</a> ll. 1180 <i>etc.</i></p>

  <p><a name="Nt34" href="#NtA34">[34]</a> Doubts are expressed, for
  example, in Trap's monumental topographical work (<i>Kongeriket
  Danmark</i>, <span class="scac">II</span>, 328, 1898).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt35" href="#NtA35">[35]</a> For example Sweyn Aageson (c.
  1200) had no doubt that the little village of Leire near Roskilde was
  identical with the Leire of story: <i>Rolf Kraki, occisus in Lethra, qvae
  tunc famosissima Regis extitit curia, nunc autem Roskildensi vicina
  civitati, inter abjectissima ferme vix colitur oppida.</i> Svenonis
  Aggonis <i>Historia Regum Daniae</i>, in Langebek, <span
  class="scac">I</span>, 45.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt36" href="#NtA36">[36]</a> <i>Ro ... patrem vero suum Dan
  colle apud Lethram tumulavit Sialandie ubi sedem regni pro eo pater
  constituit, qvam ipse post eum divitiis multiplicibus ditavit.</i> In the
  so-called <i>Annales Esromenses</i>, in Langebek, <span
  class="scac">I</span>, 224. Cf. Olrik, <i>Heltedigtning</i>, <span
  class="scac">I</span>, 188, 194. For further evidence, see <a
  href="#appG">Appendix (G)</a> below.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt37" href="#NtA37">[37]</a> We must not think of Heorot as
  an isolated country seat. The Royal Hall would stand in the middle of the
  Royal Village, as in the case of the halls of Attila (Priscus in Möller's
  <i>Fragmenta</i>, <span class="scac">IV</span>, 85) or Cynewulf (<i>A.S.
  Chronicle</i>, Anno 755).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt38" href="#NtA38">[38]</a> <i>Lethram pergitur, quod
  oppidum, a Roluone constructum eximiisque regni opibus illustratum,
  ceteris confinium prouinciarum urbibus regie fundacionis et sedis
  auctoritate prestabat.</i> Saxo, Book <span class="scac">II</span> (ed.
  Holder, p. 58).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt39" href="#NtA39">[39]</a> <i>His cognitis Helgo filium
  Roluonem Lethrica arce conclusit, heredis saluti consulturus</i> (p.
  52).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt40" href="#NtA40">[40]</a> <i>A Roe Roskildia condita
  memoratur.</i> Saxo, Book <span class="scac">II</span> (ed. Holder, p.
  51). Roe's spring, after being a feature of the town throughout the ages,
  is now (owing perhaps to its sources having been tapped by a neighbouring
  mineral-water factory) represented only by a pump in a market-garden.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt41" href="#NtA41">[41]</a> I owe this paragraph to
  information kindly supplied me by Dr Sofus Larsen, librarian of the
  University Library, Copenhagen.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt42" href="#NtA42">[42]</a> It was once believed that, in
  prehistoric times, the sea came up to Leire also (Forchhammer, Steenstrup
  and Worsaae: <i>Undersøgelser i geologisk-antiqvarisk Retning</i>,
  Kjøbenhavn, 1851). A most exact scrutiny of the geology of the coast-line
  has proved this to be erroneous. (Danmarks geologiske Undersøgelse I.R.
  6. <i>Beskrivelse til Kaartbladene Kjøbenhavn og Roskilde</i>, af K.
  Rørdam, Kjøbenhavn, 1899.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt43" href="#NtA43">[43]</a> The presence at Leire of early
  remains makes it tempting to suppose that it may have been from very
  primitive times a stronghold or sacred place. It is impossible here to
  examine these conjectures, which would connect Heorot ultimately with the
  "sacred place on the isle of the ocean" mentioned by Tacitus. The curious
  may be referred to Much in <i>P.B.B.</i> <span class="scac">XVII</span>,
  196-8; Mogk in <i>Pauls Grdr.</i> (2) <span class="scac">III</span>, 367;
  Kock in the Swedish <i>Historisk Tidskrift</i>, 1895, 162 <i>etc.</i>;
  and particularly to the articles by Sarrazin: <i>Die Hirsch Halle</i> in
  <i>Anglia</i>, <span class="scac">XIX</span>, 368-91, <i>Neue
  Beowulfstudien</i> (<i>Der Grendelsee</i>) in <i>Engl. Stud.</i> <span
  class="scac">XLII</span>, 6-15.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt44" href="#NtA44">[44]</a> This seems to me much more
  probable than, as Olrik supposes, that Froda fell in battle against
  Healfdene (<i>Skjoldungasaga</i>, 162 [80]).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt45" href="#NtA45">[45]</a> <i>Saga of Rolf Kraki</i>, cap.
  <span class="scac">IV</span>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt46" href="#NtA46">[46]</a> Olrik wishes to read the whole
  of this account, not as a prediction in the present future tense, but as
  a narrative of past events in the historic present.
  (<i>Heltedigtning</i>, <span class="scac">I</span>, 16; <span
  class="scac">II</span>, 38.) Considering the rarity of the historic
  present idiom in Old English poetry, this seems exceedingly unlikely.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt47" href="#NtA47">[47]</a> ll. 2047-2056.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt48" href="#NtA48">[48]</a> <i>Verba dei legantur in

  See Jaffé's <i>Monumenta Alcuiniana</i> (<i>Bibliotheca Rer. Germ.</i>
  <span class="scac">VI</span>), Berlin, 1873, p. 357; <i>Epistolae</i>,
  81.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt49" href="#NtA49">[49]</a> Saxo, Book <i>VI</i> (ed.
  Holder, 205, 212-13).</p>

  <p>The contrast between this lyrical outburst, and the matter-of-fact
  speech in which the old warrior in <i>Beowulf</i> eggs on the younger
  man, is thoroughly characteristic of the difference between Old English
  and Old Scandinavian heroic poetry. This difference is very noticeable
  whenever we have occasion to compare a passage in <i>Beowulf</i> with any
  parallel passage in a Scandinavian poem, and should be carefully pondered
  by those who still believe that <i>Beowulf</i> is, in its present form, a
  translation from the Scandinavian.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt52" href="#NtA52">[52]</a> Similarly, there is certainly a
  primitive connection between the names of the Geatas (Gautar) and of the
  Goths: but they are quite distinct peoples: we should not be justified in
  speaking of the Geatas as identical with the Goths.</p>

  class="scac">II</span>, 178). The reasons for the identification appear
  to me the following. Place names ending in <i>dor</i> are exceedingly
  rare. When, therefore, two independent authorities tell us that Offa
  fought at a place named <i>Fifel-dor</i> or <i>Egi-dor</i>, it appears
  unlikely that this can be a mere coincidence: it seems more natural to
  assume that the names are corruptions of one original. But further, the
  connection is not limited to the second element in the name. For the
  Eider (<i>Egidora</i>, <i>Ægisdyr</i>) would in O.E. be <i>Egor-dor</i>:
  and <i>Egor-dor</i> stands to <i>Fifel-dor</i> precisely as
  <i>egor-stream</i> (Boethius, <i>Metra</i>, <span class="scac">XX</span>,
  118) does to <i>fifel-stream</i> (<i>Metra</i>, <span
  class="scac">XXVI</span>, 26), <i>"egor" and "fifel" being
  interchangeable synonyms</i>. See note to <i>Widsith</i>, l. 43 (p. 204).
  It is objected that the interchange of <i>fifel</i> and <i>egor</i>,
  though frequent in common nouns, would be unusual in the name of a place.
  The reply is that the Old English scop may not have regarded it as a
  place-name. He may have substituted <i>fifel-dor</i> for the synonymous
  <i>egor-dor</i>, "the monster gate," without realizing that it was the
  name of a definite place, just as he would have substituted
  <i>fifel-stream</i> for <i>egor-stream</i>, "the monster stream, the
  sea," if alliteration demanded the change.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt86" href="#NtA86">[86]</a> I should hardly have thought it
  worth while to revive this old "cesspool" theory, were it not for the
  statement of Dr Lawrence that "Miller's argument that the word
  <i>grendel</i> here is not a proper name at all, that it means 'drain,'
  has never, to my knowledge, been refuted." (<i>Pub. Mod. Lang. Assoc.
  Amer.</i> <span class="scac">XXIV</span>, 253.)</p>

  <p>Miller was a scholar whose memory should be reverenced, but the letter
  to the <i>Academy</i> was evidently written in haste. The only evidence
  which Miller produced for <i>grendel</i> standing alone as a common noun
  in Old English was a charter of 963 (Birch, 1103: vol. <span
  class="scac">III</span>, p. 336): <i>þanon forð eft on grendel: þanon on
  clyst</i>: <i>grendel</i> here, he asserted, meant "drain": and
  consequently <i>gryndeles sylle</i> and <i>grendles mere</i> in the other
  charters must mean "cesspool." But the locality of this charter of 963 is
  known (Clyst St Mary, a few miles east of Exeter), and the two words
  exist there as names of streams to this day&mdash;"thence again along the
  Greendale brook, thence along the river Clyst." The Grindle or Greendale
  brook is no sewer, but a stream some half dozen miles in length which
  "winds tranquilly through a rich tract of alluvial soil" (<i>Journal of
  the Archaeol. Assoc.</i> <span class="scac">XXXIX</span>, 273), past
  three villages which bear the same name, Greendale, Greendale Barton and
  Higher Greendale, under Greendale Bridge and over the ford by Greendale
  Lane, to its junction with the Clyst. Why the existence of this charming
  stream should be held to justify the interpretation of <i>Grendel</i> or
  <i>Gryndel</i> as "drain" and <i>grendles mere</i> as "cesspool" has
  always puzzled me. Were a new Drayton to arise he might, in a new
  <i>Polyolbion</i>, introduce the nymph complaining of her hard lot at the
  hands of scholars in the Hesperides. I hope, when he next visits England,
  to conduct Dr Lawrence to make his apologies to the lady. Meantime a
  glance at the "six inch" ordnance map of Devon suffices to refute
  Miller's curious hypothesis.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt87" href="#NtA87">[87]</a> It is often asserted that the
  same Beowa appears as a witness to a charter (Müllenhoff, <i>Beovulf</i>,
  p. 8: Haak, <i>Zeugnisse zur altenglischen Heldensage</i>, 53). But this
  rests upon a misprint of Kemble (<i>C.D.S.</i> <span
  class="scac">V</span>, 44). The name is really <i>Beoba</i> (Birch,
  <i>Cart. Sax.</i> <span class="scac">I</span>, 212).</p>

  [The genealogy contains many names obviously taken from a <span
  class="scac">MS</span> of the O.E. royal pedigrees, not from oral
  tradition, as is shown by the miswritings, e.g., <i>Beaf</i> for
  <i>Beaw</i>, owing to mistaking the O.E. <i>w</i> for <i>f</i>.] "This is
  no proof," Dr Lawrence urges, "of popular acquaintance with Bjár as a
  Scandinavian figure." (<i>Pub. Mod. Lang. Assoc. Amer.</i> <span
  class="scac">XXIV</span>, 246.) But how are we to account for the
  presence of his name among a mnemonic list of some of the most famous
  warriors and their horses&mdash;mention along with heroes like Sigurd,

  <p><a name="Nt100" href="#NtA100">[100]</a> The tradition of "the devil

  together the home-keeping female and the roving male. See E. Lehmann,
  "Fandens Oldemor" in <i>Dania</i>, <span class="scac">VIII</span>,
  179-194; a paper which has been undeservedly neglected in the
  <i>Beowulf</i> bibliographies. But the devil beats his dam (cf. <i>Piers
  Plowman</i>, C-text, <span class="scac">XXI</span>, 284): conduct of
  which one cannot imagine Grendel guilty. See too Lehmann in <i>Arch. f.

  <p><a name="Nt102" href="#NtA102">[102]</a> There are other coincidences
  which <i>may</i> be the result of mere chance. In each case, before the
  adventure with the giants, the hero proves his strength by a feat of
  endurance in the ice-cold water. And, at the end of the story, the hero
  in each case produces, as evidence of his victory, a trophy with a runic
  inscription: in <i>Beowulf</i> an engraved sword-hilt; in the <i>Grettis
  saga</i> bones and a "rune-staff."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt134" href="#NtA134">[134]</a> From the controversial point

  Stein is mentioned because he was an historic character who in some way
  came into contact with the historic Grettir: for in this case his descent
  would have been given, according to the usual custom in the sagas. (Cf.
  note to Boer's edition of <i>Grettis saga</i>, p. 233.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt140" href="#NtA140">[140]</a> The localization in <i>en

  unable to get access (see p. 7 of his <i>Beowulf</i>, Note 2). A copy is
  to be found in the University Library of Christiania, in a small book
  entitled <i>Nor, en Billedbog for den norske Ungdom</i>. Christiania,
  1865. (<i>Norske Folke-Eventyr ... fortalte af P. C. Asbjørnsen</i>, pp.
  65-128.)</p>

  <p>The <i>sandhaug</i> is an extraordinary coincidence, if it <i>is</i> a
  mere coincidence. It cannot have been imported into the modern folk-tale
  from the <i>Grettis saga</i>, for there is no superficial resemblance
  between the two tales.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt142" href="#NtA142">[142]</a> Yet both Beowulf and Orm are
  saved by divine help.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt143" href="#NtA143">[143]</a> Panzer exaggerates the case
  against his own theory when he quotes only six versions as omitting the
  princesses (p. 122). Such unanimity as this is hardly to be looked for in
  a collection of 202 kindred folk-tales. In addition to these six, the
  princesses are altogether missing, for example, in the versions Panzer
  numbers 68, 69, 77: they are only faintly represented in other versions
  (e.g. 76). Nevertheless the rescue of the princesses may be regarded as
  the most essential element in the tale.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt144" href="#NtA144">[144]</a> I cannot agree with Panzer
  when (p. 319) he suggests the possibility of the <i>Beowulf</i> and the
  <i>Grettir</i>-story having been derived independently from the
  folk-tale. For the two stories have many features in common which do not
  belong to the folk-tale: apart from the absence of the princesses we have
  the <i>hæft-m&#x113;ce</i> and the strange conclusion drawn by the
  watchers from the blood-stained water.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt159" href="#NtA159">[159]</a> This objection to the
  Scyld-theory has been excellently expressed by Olrik&mdash;at a time,
  too, when Olrik himself accepted the story as belonging to Scyld rather
  than Sceaf. "Binz," says Olrik, "rejects William of Malmesbury as a
  source for the Scyld story. But he has not noticed that in doing so he
  saws across the branch upon which he himself and the other investigators
  are sitting. For if William is not a reliable authority, and even a more
  reliable authority than the others, then 'Scyld with the sheaf' is left
  in the air." <i>Heltedigtning</i>, <span class="scac">I</span>, 238-9,
  note.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt160" href="#NtA160">[160]</a> The discussion of Skjold by
  Olrik (<i>Danmarks Heltedigtning</i>, <span class="scac">I</span>,
  223-271) is perhaps the most helpful of any yet made, especially in
  emphasizing the necessity of differentiating the stages in the story. But
  it must be taken in connection with the very essential modifications made
  by Dr Olrik in his second volume (pp. 249-65, especially pp. 264-5). Dr
  Olrik's earlier interpretation made Scyld the original hero of the story:
  <i>Scefing</i> Olrik interpreted, not as "with the sheaf," but as "son of
  Scef." To the objection that any knowledge of Scyld's parentage would be
  inconsistent with his unknown origin, Olrik replied by supposing that
  Scyld was a foundling whose origin, though unknown to the people of the
  land to which he came, was well known to the poet. The poet, Dr Olrik
  thought, regarded him as a son of the Langobardic king, Sceafa, a
  connection which we are to attribute to the Anglo-Saxon love of framing
  genealogies. But this explanation of Scyld Scefing as a human foundling
  does not seem to me to be borne out by the text of <i>Beowulf</i>. "The
  child is a poor foundling," says Dr Olrik, "<i>he suffered distress from
  the time when he was first found as a helpless child</i>. Only as a grown
  man did he get compensation for his childhood's adversity" (p. 228). But
  this is certainly not the meaning of <i>egsode eorl[as]</i>. It is "<i>He
  inspired the earl[s] with awe</i>."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt162" href="#NtA162">[162]</a> "As for the name
  <i>Scyldungas-Skjöldungar</i>, we need not hesitate to believe that this
  originally meant 'the people' or 'kinsmen of the shield.' Similar
  appellations are not uncommon, e.g., <i>Rondingas</i>, <i>Helmingas</i>,
  <i>Brondingas</i> ... probably these names meant either 'the people of
  <i>the</i> shield, <i>the</i> helmet,' <i>etc.</i>, or else the people
  who used shields, helmets, <i>etc.</i>, in some special way. In the
  former case we may compare the Ancile of the Romans and the Palladion of
  the Greeks; in either case we may note that occasionally shields have
  been found in the North which can never have been used except for
  ceremonial purposes." Chadwick, <i>Origin</i>, p. 284: cf. Olrik,

  expression <i>to widan feore</i> we find occasionally <i>widan feore</i>
  in the same sense, and even in <i>Beowulf</i> we meet with <i>widan
  feorh</i>, which is not improbably the oldest form of the phrase. Before
  the loss of the final <i>-u</i> it [<i>widan feorhu</i>] would be a
  perfectly regular half verse, but the operation of this change would
  render it impossible and necessitate the substitution of a synonymous
  expression. In principle, it should be observed, the assumption of such
  substitutions seems to be absolutely necessary, unless we are prepared to
  deny that any old poems or even verses survived the period of apocope."

  A, followed by Magnússon, makes Glam <i>bláeygðr</i>, "blue-eyed": Boer

  A has <i>fon<sup>m</sup></i> or <i>fen<sup>m</sup></i>, it is difficult
  to tell which. Magnússon reads <i>fenum</i>, "morasses."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt301" href="#NtA301">[301]</a> Immediately inside the door
  of the Icelandic dwelling was the <i>anddyri</i> or vestibule. For want
  of a better word, I translate <i>anddyri</i> by "porch": but it is a
  porch inside the building. Opening out of this 'porch' were a number of
  rooms. Chief among which were the <i>skáli</i> or "hall," and the
  <i>stufa</i> or "sitting room," the latter reached by a passage
  (<i>g&#x1EB;ng</i>). These were separated from the "porch" by panelling.
  In the struggle with Glam, Grettir is lying in the hall (<i>skáli</i>),
  but the panelling has all been broken away from the great cross-beam to
  which it was fixed. Grettir consequently sees Glam enter the outer door;
  Glam turns to the <i>skáli</i>, and glares down it, leaning over the
  cross-beam; then enters the hall, and the struggle begins. See
  Guðmundssen (V.), <i>Privatbolegen på Island i Sagatiden</i>, 1889.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt302" href="#NtA302">[302]</a> The partition beams
  (<i>set-stokkar</i>) stood between the middle of the <i>skáli</i> or hall
  and the planked daïs which ran down each side. The strength of the
  combatants is such that the <i>stokkar</i> give way. Grettir gets no
  footing to withstand Glam till they reach the outer-door. Here there is a
  stone set in the ground, which apparently gives a better footing for a
  push than for a pull. So Grettir changes his tactics, gets a purchase on
  the stone, and at the same time pushes against Glam's breast, and so
  dashes Glam's head and shoulders against the lintel of the
  outer-door.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt303" href="#NtA303">[303]</a> So <span

  <p><a name="Nt304" href="#NtA304">[304]</a> Meaning that an attack by the
  evil beings would at least break the monotony.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt305" href="#NtA305">[305]</a> A passage (<i>g&#x1EB;ng</i>)
  had to be traversed between the door of the room (<i>stufa</i>) and the
  porch (<i>anddyri</i>).</p>

  <i>bælt</i>. Boer reads <i>bolat</i> "hewn down."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt307" href="#NtA307">[307]</a> A night troll, if caught by
  the sunrise, was supposed to turn into stone.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt308" href="#NtA308">[308]</a> <i>Skúta</i> may be acc. of
  the noun <i>skúti</i>, "overhanging precipice, cave"; or it may be the
  verb, "hang over." Grettir and his companion see that the sides of the
  ravine are precipitous (<i>skúta upp</i>) and so clean-cut
  (<i>meitil-berg: meitill</i>, "a chisel") that they give no hold to the
  climber. Hence the need for the rope. The translators all take
  <i>skúta</i> as acc. of <i>skúti</i>, which is quite possible: but they
  are surely wrong when they proceed to identify the <i>skúti</i> with the
  <i>hellir</i> behind the waterfall. For this cave behind the waterfall is
  introduced in the <i>saga</i> as something which Grettir discovers
  <i>after</i> he has dived beneath the fall, the fall in front naturally
  hiding it till then.</p>

  <p>The verb <i>skúta</i> occurs elsewhere in <i>Grettis saga</i>, of the
  glaciers overhanging a valley. Boer's attempt to reconstruct the scene
  appears to me wrong: cf. Ranisch in <i>A.f.d.A.</i> <span
  class="scac">XXVIII</span>, 217.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt309" href="#NtA309">[309]</a> The old editions read <i>fimm
  tigir faðma</i> "fifty fathoms": but according to Boer's collation the
  best <span class="scac">MS</span> (A) read X, whilst four of the five
  others collated give XV (<i>fimtán</i>). The editors seem dissatisfied
  with this: yet sixty to ninety feet seems a good enough height for a
  dive.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt310" href="#NtA310">[310]</a> <i>ok sat þar hjá</i>, not in
  <span class="scac">MS</span> A, nor in Boer's edition.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt320" href="#NtA320">[320]</a> This is shown by one of the

  <p><a name="Nt323" href="#NtA323">[323]</a> Zimmer (<i>Nennius

  679; Duchesne (<i>Revue Celtique</i>, <span class="scac">XV</span>, 196)
  places it more vaguely between the end of the sixth and the beginning of
  the eighth century; van Hamel (<i>Hoops Reallexikon</i> s.v.

  <p><a name="Nt328" href="#NtA328">[328]</a> The genealogies have recently
  been dealt with by E. Hackenberg, <i>Die Stammtafeln der angelsächsischen
  Königreiche</i>, Berlin, 1918; and by Brandl, (Herrig's <i>Archiv</i>,
  <span class="scac">CXXXVII</span>, 1-24). Most of Brandl's derivations
  seem to me to depend upon very perilous conjectures. Thus he derives
  <i>Sc&#x113;fing</i> from the Gr.-Lat. <i>scapha</i>, "a skiff": a word
  which was not adopted into Old English. This seems to be sacrificing all
  probability to the desire to find a new interpretation: and, even so, it

  <p><a name="Nt423" href="#NtA423">[423]</a> Mr Mackie, in an excellent
  article on the <i>Fragment</i> (<i>J.E.G.Ph.</i> <span
  class="scac">XVI</span>, 251) objects that my criticism of Hickes'
  accuracy "is not altogether judicial." Mackie urges that, since the <span
  class="scac">MS</span> is no longer extant, we cannot tell how far the
  errors are due to Hickes, and how far they already existed in the <span
  class="scac">MS</span> from which Hickes copied.</p>

  <p>But we must not forget that there are other transcripts by Hickes, of
  <span class="scac">MSS</span> which <i>are</i> still extant, and from
  these we can estimate his accuracy. It is no disrespect to the memory of
  Hickes, a scholar to whom we are all indebted, to recognize frankly that
  his transcripts are not sufficiently accurate to make them at all a
  satisfactory substitute for the original <span class="scac">MS</span>.
  Hickes' transcript of the <i>Cottonian Gnomic Verses</i>
  (<i>Thesaurus</i>, <span class="scac">I</span>, 207) shows an average of
  one error in every four lines: about half these errors are mere matters
  of spelling, the others are serious. Hickes' transcript of the
  <i>Calendar</i> (<i>Thesaurus</i>, <span class="scac">I</span>, 203)
  shows an average of one error in every six lines. When, therefore, we
  find in the <i>Finnsburg Fragment</i> inaccuracies of exactly the type
  which Hickes often commits, it would be "hardly judicial" to attribute
  these to the <span class="scac">MS</span> which he copied, and to
  attribute to Hickes in this particular instance an accuracy to which he
  has really no claim.</p>

  <p>Mr Mackie doubts the legitimacy of emending <i>Garulf</i> to
  <i>Garulf[e]</i>: but we must remember that Hickes (or his printer) was
  systematically careless as to the final <i>e</i>: cf. <i>Calendar</i>,
  15, 23, 41, 141, 144, 171, 210; <i>Gnomic Verses</i>, 45. Other forms in
  the <i>Finnsburg Fragment</i> which can be easily paralleled by Hickes'
  miswritings in the <i>Calendar</i> and <i>Gnomic Verses</i> are</p>

  <p><a name="Nt425" href="#NtA425">[425]</a> It has been suggested that
  the phrase "Hengest himself" indicates that Hengest is the "war-young
  king." But surely the expression merely marks Hengest out as a person of
  special interest. If we <i>must</i> assume that he is one of the people
  who have been speaking, then it would be just as natural to identify him
  with the watcher who has warned the king, as with the king himself. The
  difficulties which prevent us from identifying Hengest with the king are
  explained below.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt426" href="#NtA426">[426]</a> Garulf must be an assailant,
  since he falls at the beginning of the struggle, whilst we are told that
  for five days none of the defenders fell.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt427" href="#NtA427">[427]</a> Very possibly Guthere is
  uncle of Garulf. For Garulf is said to be son of Guthlaf (l. 35) and a
  <i>Guth</i>ere would be likely to be a brother of a <i>Guth</i>laf.
  Further, as Klaeber points out (<i>Engl. Stud.</i> <span
  class="scac">XXXIX</span>, 307) it is the part of the uncle to protect
  and advise the nephew.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt428" href="#NtA428">[428]</a> Koegel, <i>Geschichte d.
  deut. Litt.</i> <span class="scac">I</span>, i, 165.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt429" href="#NtA429">[429]</a> Klaeber (<i>Engl. Stud.</i>
  <span class="scac">XXXIX</span>, 308) reminds us that, as there are two
  warriors named Godric in the <i>Battle of Maldon</i> (l. 325), so there
  may be two warriors named Guthlaf here. But to this it might possibly be
  replied that "Godric" was, in England, an exceedingly common name,
  "Guthlaf" an exceedingly rare one.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt430" href="#NtA430">[430]</a> Finn is called the
  <i>bana</i>, "slayer" of Hnæf. But this does not necessarily mean that he
  slew him with his own hand; it would be enough if he were in command of
  the assailants at the time when Hnæf was slain. Cf. <i>Beowulf</i>, l.
  1968.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt431" href="#NtA431">[431]</a> The idea that Finn's Frisians
  are the "North Frisians" of Schleswig has been supported by Grein
  (<i>Eberts Jahrbuch</i>, <span class="scac">IV</span>, 270) and,
  following him, by many scholars, including recently Sedgefield
  (<i>Beowulf</i>, p. 258). The difficulties of this view are very many:
  one only need be emphasized. We first hear of these North Frisians of
  Schleswig in the 12th century, and Saxo Grammaticus tells us expressly
  that they were a colony from the greater Frisia (Book <span
  class="scac">XIV</span>, ed. Holder, p. 465). At what date this colony
  was founded we do not know. The latter part of the 9th century has been
  suggested by Langhans: so has the end of the 11th century by Lauridsen.
  However this may be, all the evidence precludes our supposing this North
  Friesland, or, as Saxo calls it, Fresia Minor, to have existed at the
  date to which we must attribute the origin of the Finn story. On this
  point the following should be consulted: Langhans (V.), <i>Ueber den
  Ursprung der Nordfriesen</i>, Wien, 1879 (most valuable on account of its
  citation of documents: the latter part of the book, which consists of an
  attempt to rewrite the Finn story by dismissing as corrupt or spurious
  many of the data, must not blind us to the value of the earlier
  portions): Lauridsen, <i>Om Nordfrisernes Indvandring i Sønderjylland,
  Historisk Tidsskrift</i>, 6 R, 4 B. <span class="scac">II</span>, 318-67,
  Kjøbenhavn, 1893: Siebs, <i>Zur Geschichte der Englisch-Friesischen
  Sprache</i>, 1889, 23-6: Chadwick, <i>Origin</i>, 94: Much in <i>Hoops
  Reallexikon</i>, s.v. <i>Friesen</i>; and Bremer in <i>Pauls Grdr.</i>
  (2), <span class="scac">III</span>, 848, where references will be found
  to earlier essays on the subject.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt432" href="#NtA432">[432]</a> The theory that Hnæf is a
  captain of Healfdene is based upon a rendering of l. 1064 which is in all
  probability wrong.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt433" href="#NtA433">[433]</a> The view that the
  <i>Eotenas</i> are the men of Hnæf and Hengest has been held by Thorpe
  (<i>Beowulf</i>, pp. 76-7), Ettmüller (<i>Beowulf</i>, 1840, p. 108),
  Bouterwek (<i>Germania</i>, <span class="scac">I</span>, 389), Holtzmann
  (<i>Germania</i>, <span class="scac">VIII</span>, 492), Möller
  (<i>Volksepos</i>, 94-5), Chadwick (<i>Origin</i>, 53), Clarke
  (<i>Sidelights</i>, 184).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt435" href="#NtA435">[435]</a> The argument of Bugge
  (<i>P.B.B.</i> <span class="scac">XII</span>, 37) that the Eotens here
  (l. 1088) must be the Frisians, is inconclusive: but so is Miss Clarke's
  argument that they must be Danes (<i>Sidelights</i>, 181), as is shown by
  Lawrence (<i>Pub. Mod. Lang. Assoc. Amer.</i> <span
  class="scac">XXX</span>, 395).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt436" href="#NtA436">[436]</a> I say "son" in what follows,
  without prejudice to the possibility of more than one son having fallen.
  It in no wise affects the argument.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt437" href="#NtA437">[437]</a> For example, it might well be
  said of Achilles, whilst thirsting for vengeance upon the Trojans for the
  death of Patroclus, that "he could not get the children of the Trojans
  out of his mind." But surely it would be unintelligible to say that "he
  could not get the child of the Achaeans out of his mind," meaning
  Patroclus, for "child of the Achaeans" is not sufficiently distinctive to
  denote Patroclus. Cf. Boer in <i>Z.f.d.A.</i> <span
  class="scac">XLVII</span>, 134.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt438" href="#NtA438">[438]</a> In the <i>Skjoldunga Saga</i>
  [extant in a Latin abstract by Arngrim Jonsson, ed. Olrik, 1894], cap.
  <span class="scac">IV</span>, mention is made of a king of Denmark named
  Leifus who had six sons, three of whom are named Hunleifus, Oddleifus and
  Gunnleifus&mdash;corresponding exactly to O.E. <i>H&#x16B;nl&#x101;f</i>,
  <i>Ordl&#x101;f</i> and <i>G&#x16B;ðl&#x101;f</i>. That Hunlaf was well
  known in English story is proved by a remarkable passage unearthed by Dr
  Imelmann from <i>MS Cotton Vesp. D. IV</i> (fol. 139 <i>b</i>) where
  Hunlaf is mentioned together with a number of other heroes of Old English
  story&mdash;Wugda, Hama, Hrothulf, Hengest, Horsa (<i>Hoc testantur gesta
  rudolphi et hunlapi, Unwini et Widie, horsi et hengisti, Waltef et
  hame</i>). See Chadwick, <i>Origin</i>, 52: R. Huchon, <i>Revue
  Germanique</i>, <span class="scac">III</span>, 626: Imelmann, in
  <i>D.L.Z.</i> <span class="scac">XXX</span>, 999: April, 1909. This
  disposes of the translation "Hun thrust or placed in his bosom Lafing,
  best of swords," which was adopted by Bugge (<i>P.B.B.</i> <span
  class="scac">XII</span>, 33), Holder, ten Brink and Gering. Hun is
  mentioned in <i>Widsith</i> (l. 33) and in the Icelandic
  <i>Thulor</i>.</p>

  <p>That Guthlaf, Ordlaf and Hunlaf must be connected together had been
  noted by Boer (<i>Z.f.d.A.</i> <span class="scac">XLVII</span>, 139)
  before this discovery of Chadwick's confirmed him.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt439" href="#NtA439">[439]</a> The fragment which tells of

  <i>swylce eal Finnsburuh f&#x233;renu w&#x1E3;re</i>, "as if all
  Finnsburg were afire." I think we may safely argue from this that the
  swords are flashing near Finnsburg. It would be just conceivable that the
  poet's mind travels back from the scene of the battle to Finn's distant
  home: "the swords made as great a flash as would have been made had
  Finn's distant capital been aflame": but this is a weak and forced
  interpretation, which we have no right to assume, though it may be
  conceivable.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt453" href="#NtA453">[453]</a> <i>Beowulf</i>, ll. 1125-7. I
  doubt whether it is possible to explain the difficulty away by supposing
  that "the warriors departing to see Friesland, their homes and their
  head-town" simply means that Finn's men, "summoned by Finn in preparation
  for the encounter with the Danes, return to their respective homes in the
  country," and that "<i>h&#x113;aburh</i> is a high sounding epic term
  that should not be pressed." This is the explanation offered by Klaeber
  (<i>J.E.G.Ph.</i> <span class="scac">VI</span>, 193) and endorsed by
  Lawrence (<i>Pub. Mod. Lang. Assoc. Amer.</i> <span
  class="scac">XXX</span>, 401). But it seems to me taking a liberty with
  the text to interpret <i>h&#x113;aburh</i> (singular) as the "respective
  homes in the country" to which Finn's warriors resort on demobilisation.
  And the statement of ll. 1125-7, that the warriors departed from the
  place of combat to see Friesland, seems to necessitate that such place of
  combat was not in Friesland. Klaeber objects to this (surely obvious)
  inference: "If we are to infer [from ll. 1125-7] that Finnsburg lies
  outside Friesland proper, we might as well conclude that <i>Dyflen</i>
  (Dublin) is not situated in Ireland according to the <i>Battle of
  Brunanburh (gewitan him þ&#x101; Norðmenn ... Dyflen s&#x113;can and eft
  &#x12A;raland</i>)." But how could anyone infer this from the
  <i>Brunanburh</i> lines? What we <i>are</i> justified in inferring, is,
  surely, that the <i>site of the battle of Brunanburh</i> (from which the
  Northmen departed to visit Ireland and Dublin) was not identical with
  Dublin, and did not lie in Ireland. And by exact parity of reason, we are
  justified in arguing that Finnsburg, the site of the first battle in
  which Hnæf fell (from which site the warriors depart to visit Friesland
  and the <i>h&#x113;aburh</i>) was not identical with the
  <i>h&#x113;aburh</i>, and did not lie in Friesland. Accordingly the usual
  view, that Finnsburg is situated outside Friesland, seems incontestable.
  See Bugge (<i>P.B.B.</i> <span class="scac">XII</span>, 29-30), Trautmann
  (<i>Finn und Hildebrand</i>, 60) and Boer (<i>Z.f.d.A.</i> <span

  Heinzel.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt456" href="#NtA456">[456]</a> Or just as the attack on the
  Danes began at night, we might suppose (as does Trautmann) that it
  equally culminated in a night assault five days later. There would be
  obvious advantage in night fighting when the object was to storm a hall:
  Flugumýrr was burnt by night, and so was the hall of Njal. So, too, was
  the hall of Rolf Kraki. It would be, then, on the morning after this
  second night assault, that Hildeburh found her kinsfolk dead.</p>

  Heyne (in his fourth edition) and in recent times Holthausen have
  interpreted <i>eoten</i> as a common noun "giant," "monster," and
  consequently "foe" in general. But they have failed to produce any
  adequate justification for interpreting <i>eoten</i> as "foe," and
  Holthausen, the modern advocate of this interpretation, has now abandoned
  it. Grundtvig (<i>Beowulfes Beorh</i>, 1861, pp. 133 <i>etc.</i>) and
  Möller (<i>Volksepos</i>, 97 <i>etc.</i>) also interpret "giant," Möller
  giving an impossible mythological explanation, which was, at the time,
  widely followed.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt460" href="#NtA460">[460]</a> I do not attach much
  importance to the argument which might be drawn from the statement of
  Binz (<i>P.B.B.</i> <span class="scac">XX</span>, 185) that the evidence
  of proper names shows that in the Hampshire district (which was colonized
  by Jutes) the legend of <i>Finnsburg</i> was particularly remembered. For
  on the other hand, as Binz points out, similar evidence is markedly
  lacking for Kent. And why, indeed, should the Jutes have specially
  commemorated a legend in which their part appears not to have been a very
  creditable one?</p>

  <p><a name="Nt463" href="#NtA463">[463]</a> Among those who have so held

  <p>So too, with some hesitation, Chadwick (<i>Orgin</i>, 52-3): with much
  more hesitation, Bugge (<i>P.B.B.</i> <span class="scac">XII</span>, 37).
  Whilst this is passing through the press Holthausen has withdrawn his
  former interpretation <i>eotena</i>, "enemies," in favour of
  <i>Eotena</i>=<i>&#x112;otna</i>, "Jutes" (<i>Engl. Stud.</i> <span

  <i>f&#x1E3;r</i> (Mod. Eng. "fear") in other Germanic languages, such as
  Old Saxon and Old High German, has the meaning of "ambush." In the nine
  places where it occurs in O.E. verse it has always the meaning of a peril
  which comes upon one suddenly, and is applied, e.g. to the Day of
  Judgement (twice) or some unexpected flood (three times). In compounds
  <i>f&#x1E3;r</i> conveys an idea of suddenness:
  "<i>f&#x1E3;r-d&#x113;að</i>, repentina mors."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt467" href="#NtA467">[467]</a> It has been surmounted in two
  ways. (1) By altering <i>eaferum</i> to <i>eaferan</i> (a very slight
  change) and then making <i>f&#x1E3;r</i> refer to the <i>final</i> attack
  upon Finn, in which he certainly <i>was</i> on the defensive (Lawrence,

  class="scac">II</span>, Klaeber, <i>Anglia</i>, <span
  class="scac">XXVIII</span>, 443, Holthausen). (2) By making
  <i>h&#x12B;&#x113;</i> refer to <i>hæleð Healf-Dena</i> which follows
  (Green in <i>Pub. Mod. Lang. Assoc. Amer.</i> <span

  <p><a name="Nt477" href="#NtA477">[477]</a> I wish I could feel
  convinced, with Ayres, that the person whom Guthlaf and Oslaf blame for

  the story so much more coherent; but if the poet really meant this, he
  assuredly did not make his meaning quite clear.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt482" href="#NtA482">[482]</a> We can construct the
  situation from such historical information as we can get from Gregory of
  Tours and other sources. The author of <i>Beowulf</i> may not have been
  clear as to the exact relation of the different tribes. We cannot tell,
  from the vague way he speaks, how much he knew.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt483" href="#NtA483">[483]</a> I have argued this at some
  length below, but I do not think anyone would deny it. Bugge recognized
  it to be true (<i>P.B.B.</i> <span class="scac">XII</span>, 29-30) as
  does Lawrence (392). See below, pp. <a href="#page288">288</a>-9.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt484" href="#NtA484">[484]</a> We can never argue that words
  are synonymous because they are parallel. Compare Psalm cxiv; in the
  first verse the parallel words are synonymous, but in the second and
  third not:</p>

  <p>"When Israel came out of Egypt and the house of Jacob from among the
  strange people" [Israel = house of Jacob: Egypt = strange people].</p>

  <p>"Judah was His sanctuary and Israel His dominion." [Judah is only one
  of the tribes of Israel.]</p>

  <p>"The sea saw that and fled: Jordan was driven back." [The Red Sea and

  <p><a name="Nt491" href="#NtA491">[491]</a> I know of only one parallel
  for such assumed adoption of a name: that also concerns the Jutes. The
  Angles, says Bede, dwelt between the Saxons and Jutes: the Jutes must,
  then, according to Bede, have dwelt north of the Angles, since the Saxons
  dwelt south. But the people north of the Angles are now, and have been
  from early times, Scandinavian in speech, whilst the Jutes who settled
  Kent obviously were not. The best way of harmonizing known linguistic
  facts with Bede's statement is, then, to assume that Scandinavians
  settled in the old continental home of these Jutes and took over their
  name, whilst introducing the Scandinavian speech.</p>

  <p>Now many scholars have regarded this as so forced and unlikely an
  explanation that they reject it, and refuse to believe that the Jutes who
  settled Kent can have dwelt north of the Angles, in spite of Bede's
  statement. If we are asked to reject the "Scandinavian-Jute" theory, as
  too unlikely on <i>a priori</i> grounds, although it is demanded by the
  express evidence of Bede, it is surely absurd to put forward a precisely
  similar theory in favour of "Frisian-Jutes" upon no evidence at all.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt507" href="#NtA507">[507]</a> Finn may perhaps be holding a
  meeting of chieftains. For similar meetings of chieftains, compare
  <i>S&#x1EB;rla þáttr</i>, cap. 4; <i>Laxdæla Saga</i>, cap. 12;
  <i>Skáldskaparmál</i>, cap. 47 (50).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt508" href="#NtA508">[508]</a> There is assuredly a
  considerable likeness between the Finn story and the Nibelungen story:
  this has been noted often enough. It is more open to dispute whether the
  likeness is so great as to justify us in believing that the Nibelungen
  story is <i>copied</i> from the Finn story, and may therefore safely be
  used as an indication how gaps in our existing versions of that story may
  be filled. See Boer in <i>Z.f.d.A.</i> <span class="scac">XLVII</span>,
  125 <i>etc.</i></p>

  <p><a name="Nt509" href="#NtA509">[509]</a> The fact that both sides have
  suffered about equally facilitates a settlement in the Teutonic feud,
  just as it does among the Afridis or the Albanians at the present
  day.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt510" href="#NtA510">[510]</a> The situation would then be
  parallel to that in <i>Laxdæla Saga</i>, cap. 60-5, where the boy
  Thorleik, aged fifteen, is nominally in command of the expedition which
  avenges his father Bolli, but is only able to accomplish his revenge by
  enlisting the great warrior Thorgils, who is the real leader of the
  raid.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt511" href="#NtA511">[511]</a> Bugge (<i>P.B.B.</i> <span
  class="scac">XII</span>, 36) interpreted this <i>swylce</i> as meaning
  that sword-bale came upon Finn in like manner as it had previously come
  upon Hnæf. But this is to make <i>swylce</i> in l. 1146 refer back to the
  death of Hnæf mentioned (72 lines previously) in l. 1074. Möller
  (<i>Volksepos</i>, 67) tries to explain <i>swylce</i> by supposing the
  passage it introduces to be a fragment detached from its context.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt524" href="#NtA524">[524]</a> I use below the form "Beow,"
  which I believe to be the correct one. "Beaw" is the form in the
  <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>. But as the name of Sceldwa, Beaw's father,
  is there given in a form which is not West-Saxon (<i>sceld</i>, not
  <i>scield</i> or <i>scyld</i>), it may well be that "Beaw" is also the
  Anglian dialect form, if it be not indeed a mere error: and this is
  confirmed by <i>Beo</i> (Ethelwerd), <i>Beowius</i> (William of
  Malmesbury), <i>Boerinus</i> (for <i>Beowinus</i>: Chronicle Roll),
  perhaps too by <i>Beowa</i> (Charter of 931) and <i>Beowi</i>, (<i>MS

  <p><a name="Nt594" href="#NtA594">[594]</a> With Grendel, thus explained,
  Rooth would connect the "Earth man" of the fairy-tale "Dat Erdmänneken"
  (see below, p. <a href="#page370">370</a>) and the name <i>Sandhaug</i>,
  <i>Sandey</i>, which clings to the Scandinavian <i>Grettir-</i> and
  <i>Orm-</i>stories. We have seen that a <i>sandhaug</i> figures also in
  one of the Scandinavian cognates of the folk-tale (see above, p. <a

  be perilous to draw deductions from them.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt621" href="#NtA621">[621]</a> The absence of the West-Saxon
  pedigree may be due to the document from which the <i>Historia
  Brittonum</i> and the <i>Vespasian MS</i> derive these pedigrees having
  been drawn up in the North: Wessex may have been outside the purview of
  its compiler; though against this is the fact that it contains the
  Kentish pedigree. But another quite possible explanation is, that Cerdic,
  with his odd name, was not of the right royal race, but an adventurer,
  and that it was only later that a pedigree was made up for his
  descendants, on the analogy of those possessed by the more blue-blooded
  monarchs of Mercia and Northumbria.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt623" href="#NtA623">[623]</a> It is prefixed to the
  <i>Parker MS</i> of the <i>Chronicle</i>, and is found also in the
  Cambridge <span class="scac">MS</span> of the Anglo-Saxon Bede (<i>Univ.

  class="scac">XII</span>, 106 <i>etc.</i> There are uncollated copies in
  <i>MS C.C.C.C.</i> 383, fol. 107, and according to Liebermann (Herrig's

  however include the portion under consideration, in <i>MS Add.</i> 23211
  (<i>Brit. Mus.</i>) printed in Sweet's <i>Oldest English Texts</i>, p.
  179. The statement, sometimes made, that there is a copy in <i>MS

  to the <i>Parker MS</i> of the <i>Chronicle</i> (<i>C.C.C.C.</i>
  173).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt663" href="#NtA663">[663]</a> Thus, much space has been
  devoted to discussing whether "Gotland," in the eleventh century Cotton
  <span class="scac">MS</span> of Alfred's Orosius, signifies Jutland. I
  believe that it does; but fail to see how it can be argued from this that
  Alfred believed the Jutes to be "Geatas." Old English had no special
  symbol for the semi-vowel <i>J</i>; so, to signify <i>J&#x14D;tland</i>,
  Alfred would have written "Geotland" (Sievers, <i>Gram.</i> §§ 74, 175).
  Had he meant "Land of the Geatas" he would have written "Geataland" or
  "Geatland." Surely "Gotland" is nearer to "Geotland" than to
  "Geatland."</p>

  <i>P.B.B.</i> <span class="scac">XII</span>, 6. "<i>Geátas</i> ... ist
  sprachlich ein ganz anderer name als altn. <i>Jótar</i>, <i>Jútar</i>,

  <p><a name="Nt672" href="#NtA672">[672]</a> From a presumed Prim. Germ.
  <i>*Eutiz</i>, <i>*Eutjaniz</i>. The word in O.E. seems to have been
  declined both as an <i>i</i>-stem and an <i>n</i>-stem, the <i>n</i>-stem
  forms being used more particularly in the gen. plu., just as in the case
  of the tribal names, <i>Seaxe</i>, <i>Mierce</i> (Sievers, § 264). The
  Latinized forms show the same duplication, the dat. <i>Euciis</i>
  pointing to an <i>i</i>-stem, the nom. <i>Euthio</i> to an <i>n</i>-stem,
  plu. <i>*Eutiones</i>. For a discussion of the relation of the O.E. name
  to the Danish <i>Jyder</i>, see Björkman in <i>Anglia, Beiblatt,</i>
  <span class="scac">XXVIII</span>, 274-80: "Zu ae. <i>Eote</i>,
  <i>Yte</i>, dän. <i>Jyder</i> 'Jüten'."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt673" href="#NtA673">[673]</a> I regard it as simply an
  <i>error</i> of the translator, possibly because he had before him a text
  in which Bede's <i>Iutis</i> had been corrupted in this place into
  <i>Giotis</i>, as it is in Ethelwerd: <i>Cantuarii de Giotis traxerunt
  originem, Vuhtii quoque</i>. (Bk. <span class="scac">I</span>: other
  names which Ethelwerd draws from Bede in this section are equally
  corrupt.)</p>

  <p>Bede's text runs: (<span class="scac">I</span>, 15) <i>Aduenerant
  autem de tribus Germaniae populis fortioribus, id est Saxonibus, Anglis,
  Iutis. De Iutarum origine sunt Cantuarii et Victuarii</i>; in the

  <p><a name="Nt682" href="#NtA682">[682]</a> <i>Geta</i> was the
  recognized Latin synonym for <i>Gothus</i>, and is used in this sense in
  the sixth century, e.g. by Venantius Fortunatus and Jordanes. And the
  Götar are constantly called <i>Gothi</i>, e.g. in the formula <i>rex
  Sueorum et Gothorum</i> (for the date of this formula see Söderqvist in
  the <i>Historisk Tidskrift</i>, 1915: <i>Ägde Uppsvearne rätt att taga
  och vräka konung</i>); or Saxo, Bk. <span class="scac">XIII</span> (ed.
  Holder, p. 420, describing how the <i>Gothi</i> invited a candidate to be
  king, and slew the rival claimant, who was supported by the legally more
  constitutional suffrages of the Swedes); or Adam of Bremen (as quoted
  below).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt684" href="#NtA684">[684]</a> Speaking of the Götaelv, Adam

  Modern scholars are of the opinion that the borrowing has been rather the
  other way. According to Noreen the river Götaelv (Gautelfr) gets its name
  as the outflow from Lake Væner. (Cf. O.E. <i>g&#x113;otan</i>,
  <i>g&#x113;at</i>, "pour.") Götland (Gautland) is the country around the
  river, and the Götar (Gautar) get their name from the country. See
  Noreen, <i>Våra Ortnamn och deras Ursprungliga Betydelse</i>, in
  <i>Spridda Studier</i>, <span class="scac">II</span>, 91, 139.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt685" href="#NtA685">[685]</a> The Scholiast, in his
  commentary on Adam, records the later state of things, when the Götar
  were confined to the south of the river: "Gothelba fluvius a Nordmannis

  <p><a name="Nt707" href="#NtA707">[707]</a> This grave mound is mentioned
  as "Kong Ottars Hög" in <i>Ättartal för Swea och Götha Kununga Hus</i>,
  by J. Peringskiöld, Stockholm, 1725, p. 13, and earlier, in 1677, it is
  mentioned by the same name in some notes of an antiquarian survey. That
  the name "Vendel-crow" is now attached to it is stated by Dr Almgren.
  These early references seem conclusive: little weight could, of course,
  be carried by the modern name alone, since it might easily be of learned
  origin. The mound was opened in 1914-16, and the contents showed it to
  belong to about 500 to 550 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>, which agrees
  excellently with the date of Ohthere. See two articles in
  <i>Fornvännen</i> for 1917: an account of the opening of the mound by S.
  Lindqvist entitled "Ottarshögen i Vendel" (pp. 127-43) and a discussion
  of early Swedish history in the light of archaeology, by B. Nerman,

  recent Danish scholars have placed these deposits in the fifth century,
  with some overlapping into the preceding and succeeding centuries
  (Müller, <i>Vor Oldtid</i>, 561; Wimmer, <i>Die Runenschrift</i>, 301,
  <i>etc.</i>). The Swedish archæologists, Knut Stjerna and O. Almgren,

  <p><a name="Nt731" href="#NtA731">[731]</a> I would suggest this as the
  more likely because, if the ring were inserted for a practical purpose,
  it is not easy to see why it later survived in the form of a mere knob,
  which is neither useful nor ornamental. But if it were used to attach the
  symbolical "peace bands," it may have been retained, in a "fossilized
  form," with a symbolical meaning.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt732" href="#NtA732">[732]</a> Most editors indeed do take
  it in this sense, though recently Schücking has adopted Stjerna's
  explanation of "ring-sword." In l. 322, Falk (27) takes
  <i>hring-&#x12B;ren</i> to refer to a "ring-adorned sword," though it may
  well mean a ring-byrnie.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt733" href="#NtA733">[733]</a> Actually, I believe, more:
  for two ring-swords were found at Faversham, and are now in the British
  Museum. For an account of one of them see Roach Smith, <i>Collectanea
  Antiqua</i>, 1868, vol. <span class="scac">VI</span>, 139. In this
  specimen both the fixed ring and the ring which moves within it are
  complete circles. But in the Gilton sword (<i>Archæologia</i>, <span
  class="scac">XXX</span>, 132) and in the sword discovered at Bifrons
  (<i>Archæologia Cantiana</i>, <span class="scac">X</span>, 312) one of
  the rings no longer forms a complete circle, and in the sword discovered
  at Sarre (<i>Archæol. Cant.</i> <span class="scac">VI</span>, 172) the
  rings are fixed together, and one of them has little resemblance to a
  ring at all.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt734" href="#NtA734">[734]</a> At Concevreux. It is
  described by M. Jules Pilloy in <i>Mémoires de la Société Académique de
  St Quentin</i>, 4<sup>e</sup> Sér. tom. <span class="scac">XVI</span>,
  1913; see esp. pp. 36-7.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt736" href="#NtA736">[736]</a> Salin has no doubt that the
  Swedish type from Uppland (his figure 252) is later than even the latest
  type of English ring-sword (the Sarre pommel, 251) which is itself later
  than the Faversham (249) or Bifrons (250) pommel. See Salin (B.), <i>Die
  Altgermanische Thierornamentik</i>, Stockholm, 1904, p. 101. The same
  conclusion is arrived at by Lindenschmit: "Die ursprüngliche Form ist
  wohl in dem, unter Nr. 249 von Salin abgebildeten Schwertknopf aus Kent
  zu sehen"; and even more emphatically by Pilloy, who pronounces the
  Swedish Vendel sword both on account of its "ring" and other
  characteristics, as "inspirée par un modèle venu de cette contrée
  [Angleterre]."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt768" href="#NtA768">[768]</a> It is somewhat similar in

  inherited from of old, or coming from abroad: cf. Falk, 38-41.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt769" href="#NtA769">[769]</a> <i>Beowulf</i>, 1489,
  <i>w&#x1E3;gsweord</i>; cf. <i>Vægir</i> as a sword-name in the
  <i>Thulur</i>. In ll. 1521, 1564, 2037, <i>hringm&#x1E3;l</i> may refer
  to the ring in the hilt, and terms like <i>wunden</i>- are more likely to
  refer to the serpentine ornament of the hilt. This must be the case with
  <i>wyrm-f&#x101;h</i> (1698) as it is a question of the hilt alone.
  Stjerna (p. 111 = <i>Essays</i>, 20) and others take
  <i>&#x101;ter-t&#x101;num f&#x101;h</i> (1459) as referring to the
  damascened pattern (cf. <i>eggjar ... eitrdropom innan fáþar; Brot af

  <i>t&#x101;n</i> here refers to an edge welded-on: the Icelandic

  These helms had long been known from a specimen (place of origin
  uncertain) in the Hermitage at Petrograd, and another example, that of
  Vézeronce, supposed to have been lost in the battle between Franks and
  Burgundians in 524. Seven other examples have been discovered in the last
  quarter of a century, including those of Baldenheim (for which see

  mentioned R. Müller, <i>Untersuchungen über die Namen des Liber

  <p><a name="Nt815" href="#NtA815">[815]</a> Both Grimm and Skeat
  suggested the woodpecker, which feeds upon bees and their larvae: Grimm
  appealing to classical mythology, Skeat instancing the bird's courage.
  But nothing seems forthcoming from Teutonic mythology to favour this
  interpretation. Cosijn, following Sijmons, <i>Z.f.d.Ph.</i> <span
  class="scac">XXIV</span>, 17, thought bees might have been an omen of
  victory. But there is no satisfactory evidence for this. The term
  <i>sigew&#x12B;f</i> applied to the swarming bees in the <i>Charms</i>
  (Cockayne's <i>Leechdoms</i>, <span class="scac">I</span>, 384) is
  insufficient.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt817" href="#NtA817">[817]</a> <i>Deutsches Wörterbuch</i>,
  1854, <span class="scac">I</span>, 1122.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt818" href="#NtA818">[818]</a> "Das compositum Beóvulf, wie
  Gôzolf, Irminolf, Reginolf, und andre gebildet, zeigt nur einen helden
  und krieger im geist und sinn oder von der art des Beówa an. Ihm
  entspricht altn. Biôlfr." (Müllenhoff, in <i>Z.f.d.A.</i> <span
  class="scac">XII</span>, 284.) But certainly this interpretation is
  impossible for O.N. <i>Biólfr</i>: "warrior of Beowa" would be
  <i>*Byggulfr</i>, which we nowhere find. See Björkman in <i>Engl.
  Stud.</i> <span class="scac">LII</span>, 191. Müllenhoff at this date,
  whilst not connecting <i>B&#x113;owulf</i> directly with
  <i>b&#x113;o</i>, "bee," did so connect <i>B&#x113;owa</i>, whom he
  interpreted as a bee-god or bee-father. But there is no evidence for
  this, and the <i>w</i> of <i>B&#x113;owa</i> tells emphatically against
  it. Müllenhoff subsequently abandoned this explanation.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt819" href="#NtA819">[819]</a> It is actually written
  <i>Biu<sup>u</sup>ulf</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt820" href="#NtA820">[820]</a> <i>Biu</i> in <i>Biuuulf</i>
  cannot stand for <i>B&#x113;o</i> [older <i>Beu</i>] because in Old
  Northumbrian <i>iu</i> and <i>eo</i> are rigidly differentiated, as an
  examination of all the other names in the <i>Liber Vitae</i> shows. As
  Sievers points out, if <i>Biuuulf</i> is to be derived from <i>*Beuw
  (w)ulf</i>, then it would afford an isolated and inexplicable case of
  <i>iu</i> for <i>eo[eu]</i>, unique in the <i>Liber Vitae</i>, as in the
  whole mass of the oldest English texts: "Soll ein zusammenhang mit st.
  <i>beuwa-</i> stattfinden, so muss man auch diesen stamm für einen urspr.
  s-stamm erklären, und unser <i>biu-</i> auf die stammform
  <i>biuwi(z)-</i> nicht auf <i>beuwa(z)-</i> zurückführen." (Sievers,
  <i>P.B.B.</i> <span class="scac">XVIII</span>, 413.) The word however is
  a neut. <i>wa</i>-stem, whether in O.E. (<i>b&#x113;ow</i>), Old Saxon
  (<i>b&#x113;o</i>) or Icelandic (<i>bygg</i>): see Sievers, <i>Ags.
  Grammatik</i>, 3te Aufl. § 250; Gallée, <i>Altsächsische Grammatik</i>,
  2te Aufl. § 305; Noreen, <i>Altisländische Grammatik</i>, 3te Aufl. §
  356. The word is extant in Old English only in the Glossaries, in the
  gen. sing., "handful beouaes," <i>etc.</i>, and in Old Saxon only in the
  gen. plu. <i>beuuo</i>. It is thought to have been originally a
  <i>wu</i>-stem, which subsequently, as e.g. in O.E., passed into a
  <i>wa</i>-stem. (See Noreen, <i>A.f.n.F.</i> <span class="scac">I</span>,
  166, arguing from the form <i>begg</i> in the Dalecarlian dialect.) The
  presumed Primitive Norse form is <i>beggwu</i>, whence the various
  Scandinavian forms, Icel. <i>bygg</i>, Old Swedish and Old Danish
  <i>biug(g)</i>. See Hellquist in <i>A.f.n.F.</i> <span
  class="scac">VII</span>, 31; von Unwerth, <i>A.f.n.F.</i> <span
  class="scac">XXXIII</span>, 331; Binz, <i>P.B.B.</i> <span

  p. 314, in <i>Lunds Universitets årsskrift</i>, Bd. <span
  class="scac">XII</span>. The proper name <i>Byggvir</i> is a
  <i>ja</i>-stem, but <i>B&#x113;ow</i> cannot have been so formed, as a
  <i>ja</i>-stem would give the form <i>B&#x113;owe</i>. Cosijn
  (<i>Aanteekeningen</i>, 42) was accordingly justified in pointing to the
  form <i>Biuuulf</i> as refuting Kögel's attempt to connect
  <i>B&#x113;owulf</i> with <i>B&#x113;ow</i> through a form
  <i>*Bawiwulf</i> (<i>A.f.d.A.</i> <span class="scac">XVIII</span>, 56).
  Kögel replied with a laboured defence (<i>Z.f.d.A.</i> <span
  class="scac">XXXVII</span>, 268): he starts by assuming that
  <i>B&#x113;ow</i> and <i>B&#x113;owulf</i> are etymologically connected,
  which is the very point which has to be proved: he has to admit that, if
  his etymology be correct, the <i>Biuuulf</i> of the <i>Liber Vitae</i> is
  not the same form as <i>B&#x113;owulf</i>, which is the very point Cosijn
  urged as telling against his etymology: and even so his etymological
  explanations depend upon stages which cannot be accepted in the present
  state of our knowledge (see especially Sievers in <i>P.B.B.</i> <span
  class="scac">XVIII</span>, 413; Björkman in <i>Engl. Stud.</i> <span

  <p><a name="Nt872" href="#NtA872">[872]</a> Many recent historians have
  expressed doubts as to the conventional date, 515, for Hygelac's death.
  J. P. Jacobsen, in the Danish translation of Gregory (1911) suggested
  525-30: following him Severinsen (<i>Danske Studier</i>, 1919, 96)
  suggested c. 526, as did Fredborg, <i>Det första årtalet i Sveriges
  historia</i>. L. Schmidt (<i>Geschichte der deutschen Stämme</i>, <span
  class="scac">II</span>, 500, <i>note</i>, 1918) suggested c. 528.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt873" href="#NtA873">[873]</a> Archæological works bearing
  less directly upon <i>Beowulf</i> are enumerated in <i><a
  href="#appF">Appendix F</a></i>; that enumeration is not repeated
  here.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt874" href="#NtA874">[874]</a> Most students nowadays will
  probably agree with v. Sydow's contention that the struggle of Beowulf,
  first above ground and then below, is a folk-story, one and indivisible,
  and that therefore there is no reason for attributing the two sections to
  different authors, as do Boer, Müllenhoff and ten Brink. But that the
  folk-tale is exclusively Celtic remains to be proved; v. Sydow's
  contention that Celtic influence is shown in <i>Beowulf</i> by the
  inhospitable shamelessness of Unferth (compare that of Kai) is surely
  fanciful. Also the statement that the likeness of Bjarki and Beowulf is
  confined to the freeing of the Danish palace from a dangerous monster by
  a stranger from abroad, and that "das sonstige Beiwerk völlig verschieden
  ist" surely cannot be maintained. As argued above (pp. 54-61) there are
  other distinct points of resemblance.</p>

  <p>v. Sydow's statement no doubt suffers from the brevity with which it
  is reported, and his forthcoming volume of <i>Beowulf studien</i> will be
  awaited with interest.</p>
